===============================================================================
2009-08-06  OpenCORE 2.05

New Features
- Helper function to retrieve extended messages from command responses.

- Support for eAAC+ encode in the pvAuthor engine.

- Add conversion operations to OSCL_String classes.

- RTSPT support (3GPP streaming over TCP). To test, replace "rtsp" with "rtspt"
in the control URL (in source URL or SDP file). It is assumed that the user has
access to a server with TCP streaming capability.

- PV Metadata Engine (ME). This engine is targeted at applications that want
to retrieve metadata for any given clip in a generic manner. Typically, a lot
of these applications would like to scan large batches of content. Since ME 
is mainly targeted at apps like mediascanner, where speed is the most important
factor, thumbnail extraction is not supported. For applications that do want 
to extract thumbnails in a generic manner along with the metadata, PV's 
FrameAndMetadata Utility (FMU) is recommended instead.

- 2way Lip-Sync unit test cases.


Improvement
- A new base node implementation is introduced for the purpose of 
  refactoring and consolidating common logic in the nodes. The changes
  will improve maintainability and make it easier to create new nodes.
  Further documentation will be released in the future providing guidelines
  for authoring nodes.
- The following existing nodes were refactored to utilize the base node 
  implementation mentioned above: AAC, AMR, and WAV parser nodes.
- Replace CodecSpecifier with PVMFFormatType.
- Move EventHandlerProcessing method to PVMFOMXBaseDecNode class.
- Change method type from "protected" to "private" in OMX derived classes
(videodec node and audiodec node).

===============================================================================
2009-05-17  OpenCORE 2.04

New Features
- Create external download datastream An external download datastream is
introduced to allow for an external entity to pass a datastream interface 
to the player SDK.  The external entity is responsible for doing the actual 
download of the media data.  Full support in Android is not complete until 
playerdriver changes and more unit testing is done.

- Fixed cache option in Oscl_File
Adding an option to configure the Oscl file cache to use one or more fixed
caches in addition to the movable cache.

- Modify author engine to contain a notion of "authoring clock"
Author engine has the option to pass an "authoring clock" to media input
components so that they can use this to sync audio and video timestamps.  
Author engine has been modified to own a PVMFMediaClock.  Author engine 
provides a pointer to its to data source node (media input node typically) 
at the end of author engine Init cycle, using PVMF_AUTHORING_CLOCK_KEY.  
No media input component changes were done. All media input components 
used in author engine unit test currently operate from a file and have no
need for such a clock, but some device media input components can make use 
of the clock if needed in the future, since author engine will pass the 
clock pointer all the time to data sources.

- Shoutcast (of MP3) support
Shoutcast support of MP3 and internet radio streaming is added.

- Enable AAC PDL Support 
More robust support of PDL of AAC content, including underflow handling.

- Add support for 3GPP2 speech (EVRC, QCELP etc) in MP4 FF library
Support for the 3GPP2 speech codecs is added at the file format library
level.  No 3GPP2 speech codecs are added.

- OpenMAX encoder and decoder unit test suite

- Use external filehandle in Android

- Introduce new macro to android makefiles to enable 2way


Improvements

- OMX video dec node now sets the codec parameters (width/height etc.) in the 
  output port of the omx component.
- A loadable module for the OMA1 passthru CPM plugin now exists.  It serves 
  as an example for creating a loadable CPM plugin.
- Compressed testcases have been added in Authior Engine unit tests to 
  author 3gp file from AVC and M4V and AAC bitstreams
- Added checks to verify that the PCM output of the mp3 frame will not exceed
  the output buffer size, so the mp3 decoder / OMX component is nore robust.
- Removed unnecessary "ComponentGetRolesOfComponent" methods from OMX 
  components.
- Restored "/x-pvmf/ff-mux/mp4" MIME Type in Author engine. 
- Modified the Initial AVC buffers so that the image that appears initially 
  is black (not green/pink) if I-frame is missing. 
- Fixed the IFrameInterval setting in the OpenMAX video encoder node. 
- Added the ability to pass a peer PvmiCapabilityAndConfig interface to 
  the Media I/O (MIO) components using the Capability Exchange.  The purpose 
  is to allow the MIO components to set and get parameters (i.e., drive the 
  process) rather than on relying on the media output node to do it.
- Added checks to the OMX components to verify that the buffer size 
  (in allocate/use buffer) (nAllocLen) is adequate (i.e. >= than nBufferSize)
- Updated OMX components so that standard component roles can be queried as 
  well as set.
- AMR-NB common library modified to mark the proper symbol exports and moved
  some functions to encoder and decoder libraries instead of common. 
- Updated h264 decoder to take advantage of the fact that there will be no 
  in-band SPS/PPS NALs for the mime Video dec node prevents in-band SPS/PPS 
  for the format PVMF_MIME_H264_VIDEO_MP4
- Add macro for enabling build of pv test engine executables in Android 
- Remove 12-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit routines from Android libraries 
- Modified OMX timestamps to be in in microseconds rather than milliseconds
  as specified in the OMX spec 1.1.2.
- Improvements and workarounds for non-compliant OMX components
- Replace OPEN_FILE_ONCE_PER_TRACK macro with member variable 
aOpenFileOncePerTrack in mp4ffparser lib
- 2way: send data fragment by fragment from parser side
- Added a new function to convert PVMFStatus to human friendly strings
- Implement logic to choose correct OMX component when decoding streaming 
H264
- OMX dec nodes should report error and not even call config parser if 
config data is missing (but is required by the format)

  and DiscardTS
- Change pv omx encoder node to default iOMXComponentNeedsNALStartCodes to 
  false and do sanity check
- When reconfig happen,SinkNode should send reconfig notification with 
  FormatSpecificInfo to MIO 
- Race condition - If port settings event and node stop command arrive 
  simultaneously - omx component may fail port flush command 
- Mp3FFParserNode: Memory leak in Duration Calculator 
- Playback clock starts even before PlayerEngine Start( ) is issued 
- Clip plays beyond EOS.  Fixed setting of the actual normal play time (NPT)
  when repositioning. 
- Modified OSCL and player driver handling of external file handles in the 
  player.
- MP3 PS - Repositioning is not working properly 
- MP3 Parser needs to validate consecutive mp3 headers before parsing starts

2009-03-31  OpenCORE 2.03

Improvements
- Enable OpenCORE on master - part 2


===============================================================================
2009-03-10  OpenCORE 2.02

********
   There is minor version number nomenclature change where the 
   minor version is now two digits.  So the previous releases 
   in the new nomenclature are 2.00 (2.0) and 2.01 (2.1).  The 
   new release is 2.02, which is a minor version increment beyond
   the previous release.
********

New Features

  an OMX AMR-WB encoder component if it is part of the OMX core. 
- Buffer allocator mechanism allowing the Media I/O components to 
  supply buffers to the OMX decoders.  This method is especially useful
  as an alternative way to allocate video buffers.  Details can be 
  found in the new document "Guide to Supplying Decoder Buffers from 
  the MIO Component" in the file mio_decoder_buffer_allocation_guide.pdf
  in the top-level doc directory.

Improvements
- Resolution of Valgrind and static analysis warnings in player and author

- Modified OMX encoder node to allow setting the AMR bitrate 
  based on an extension interface value.
- Fix inconsistencies in OSCL find method related to inclusion of the 
  directory name with the filename.
- Improvement in PVMFInfoErrorHandlingComplete in the player datapath
- Refactor of the Protocol Engine node to support a plugin architecture.  
  This improves extensibility of the module for new features in the future.

  Reset processing.  


===============================================================================
2009-02-26  OpenCORE 2.1 (2.01)

New Features
* OpenMAX Codec-related:
  - Introduced the OMXConfigParser API to help in determining
    which OpenMAX components can support the input bitstream.
    It is used to narrow the list of candidate OpenMAX components
    to be used for playback.  See the OpenMAX Core Integration Guide
    document in the doc directory for more information.
  - Added OMX AAC encoder support in the OMX encoder.
  - Modified to use separate component roles for AMR-NB and AMR-WB as
    described in the OpenMAX IL spec version 1.1.2.
  - Added support for a new buffer format for H.264/AVC decode and
    encode to allow passing multiple NALs in a single buffer.  
    The format uses OMX_OTHER_EXTRADATA structure defined in 
    section 4.2.33 of the OpenMAX IL spec version 1.1.2 to pass 
    NAL lengths.  See the OpenMAX Core Integration Guide document 
    in the doc directory for more information.
* Author-related:
  - Added support for authoring files with AAC audio.
  - Added support for authoring AMR-WB audio to MP4/3GP files and
    IETF storage format.
  - Added support for writing to an open file descriptor as an option
    instead of simply providing a filename.  The file descriptor
    option is useful for cases where another process needs to open 
    the file because of permissions.
* Added large file support in OSCL (i.e., 64-bit file size/offset
    support) to handle files greater than 2 GiB on filesystems that 
  support it.
* Added rotation support in the 32-bit color-conversion class.

Improvements
* Removed dynamically loaded modules from the prelink map to avoid
  clutter and to make both the prelink map and loadable modules 
  easier to manage.  There may be an issue if a single instance of 
  a process tries to load libraries not in the prelink map more than 
  256 times
  (See http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2042).
* Update to the MP3 Decoder to fix security issue (oCERT_2009-002,
  CVE-2009-0475)
* Renamed the OSCL config directory linux_nj to android to match the
  platform name.  Replaced all references of nj with android in the 
  codebase.
* General security improvements found from static analysis in the
  following areas:
  - Buffer and type overruns and underruns
  - Null pointer references
* Refactored the jitter buffer node into a more modular architecture
  for better support of different streaming use-cases and protocols.
* Fixed an issue in the MP3 decoder when decoding for very of long
  durations (over 2 GiB of data).
* General improvements found during 3GPP packet-switched streaming
  interoperability testing.
* General improvements and resolution of issues found from module
  level and engine (player, author, 2-way) level unit testing.

New APIs / Behaviors
* Added support in the player engine to cancel a single pending
  command using the CancelCommand API.  See the player engine API 
  document for details.
* Renumbered the author test cases to avoid issues with
  preprocessor conditionals changing the test numbers based on 
  settings.  Now the test numbers shouldn't change.
* In the case of 3rd party OMX components that support multiple roles,
  returns an error if the component cannot set the role parameter
* OMX components need to explicitly set nPortIndex parameter for
  all appropriate parameters
* Added fix for buffering percentage notification in streaming
  scenario (see https://review.source.android.com/Gerrit#change,8699)
* Updated omx shared library build configuration to separate component
  registration from component build
* Added methods in baselibs to serialize and deserialize the UTF-16,
  UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE strings
* Removed the iUseCPMPluginRegistry flag from the source data that was
  previously used to enable the content policy manager.  
  Since the CPM pluginsare dynamically loaded, the flag is not 
  needed and was removed.  See the playerdriver.cpp for details
  of the change.
