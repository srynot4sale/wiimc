DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       mmppllaayyeerr is a movie player for Linux (runs on many other  platforms  and
       CPU  architectures,  see  the  documentation).  It plays most MPEG/VOB,
       AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo,
       yuv4mpeg,  FILM  and  RoQ  files,  supported  by many native and binary
       codecs.  You can watch VCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5, WMV  and  even
       H.264 movies, too.

       MPlayer  supports  a  wide range of video and audio output drivers.  It
       works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,  AAlib,  libcaca,  Di-
       rectFB,  Quartz, Mac OS X CoreVideo, but you can also use GGI, SDL (and
       all their drivers), VESA (on every VESA-compatible card,  even  without
       X11),  some  low-level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3dfx and ATI)
       and some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the Siemens  DVB,  Haup-
       pauge PVR (IVTV), DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.  Most of them support soft-
       ware or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen mode.

       MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice  big
       antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
       European/ISO8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Ko-
       rean fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, Sub-
       Rip, OGM, SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS  and
       our  own: MPsub) and DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and Closed Cap-
       tions).

       mmeennccooddeerr (MPlayer's Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder,  designed
       to encode MPlayer-playable movies (see above) to other MPlayer-playable
       formats (see below).  It encodes to  MPEG-4  (DivX/Xvid),  one  of  the
       libavcodec  codecs  and PCM/MP3/VBRMP3 audio in 1, 2 or 3 passes.  Fur-
       thermore it has stream copying  abilities,  a  powerful  filter  system
       (crop, expand, flip, postprocess, rotate, scale, noise, RGB/YUV conver-
       sion) and more.

       ggmmppllaayyeerr is MPlayer with a graphical user interface.  It has  the  same
       options as MPlayer.

       Usage  examples  to  get you started quickly can be found at the end of
       this man page.

       MPlayer has a fully configurable, command-driven  control  layer  which
       allows you to control MPlayer using keyboard, mouse, joystick or remote
       control (with LIRC).  See the -input option for ways to customize it.

       Every 'flag' option has a 'noflag' counterpart, e.g.  the  opposite  of
       the -fs option is -nofs.

       If  an option is marked as (XXX only), it will only work in combination
       with the XXX option or if XXX is compiled in.

       _N_O_T_E_: The suboption parser (used for example for  -ao  pcm  suboptions)
       supports a special kind of string-escaping intended for use with exter-
       nal GUIs.
       It has the following format:
       %n%string_of_length_n
       _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_S_:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%10%C:test.wav test.avi
       Or in a script:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%`expr length "$NAME"`%"$NAME" test.avi

       You can put all of the options in configuration  files  which  will  be
       read every time MPlayer/MEncoder is run.  The system-wide configuration
       file 'mplayer.conf' is in  your  configuration  directory  (e.g.  /etc/
       mplayer or /usr/local/etc/mplayer), the user specific one is '~/.mplay-
       er/config'.  The configuration file for MEncoder is 'mencoder.conf'  in
       your  configuration  directory  (e.g.  /etc/mplayer  or /usr/local/etc/
       mplayer), the user specific one  is  '~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf'.   User
       specific  options override system-wide options and options given on the
       command line override either.  The syntax of the configuration files is
       'option=<value>',  everything after a '#' is considered a comment.  Op-
       tions that work without values can be enabled by setting them to  'yes'
       or  '1'  or  'true'  and  disabled  by  setting  them to 'no' or '0' or
       'false'.  Even suboptions can be specified in this way.

       You can also write file-specific configuration files.  If you  wish  to
       have  a configuration file for a file called 'movie.avi', create a file
       named 'movie.avi.conf' with the file-specific options in it and put  it
       in  ~/.mplayer/.   You  can also put the configuration file in the same
       directory  as  the  file  to  be  played,  as  long  as  you  give  the
       -use-filedir-conf  option (either on the command line or in your global
       config file).

       To ease working with different configurations profiles can  be  defined
       in  the  configuration  files.   A profile starts with its name between
       square brackets, e.g. '[my-profile]'.  All following  options  will  be
       part of the profile.  A description (shown by -profile help) can be de-
       fined with the profile-desc option.  To end the profile, start  another
       one  or use the profile name 'default' to continue with normal options.

       --mmssggcchhaarrsseett <<cchhaarrsseett>>
              Convert console messages to the  specified  character  set  (de-
              fault: autodetect).  Text will be in the encoding specified with
              the --charset configure option.  Set this to "noconv" to disable
              conversion (for e.g. iconv problems).
              _N_O_T_E_:  The  option  takes  effect after command line parsing has
              finished.  The MPLAYER_CHARSET environment variable can help you
              get rid of the first lines of garbled output.

       --mmssggccoolloorr
              Enable  colorful  console  output on terminals that support ANSI

              Control verbosity directly for each module.   The  'all'  module
              changes  the  verbosity of all the modules not explicitly speci-
              fied on the command line.  See '-msglevel help' for  a  list  of
              all modules.
              _N_O_T_E_:  Some  messages  are  printed  before  the command line is
              parsed and are therefore not affected by -msglevel.  To  control
              these  messages  you have to use the MPLAYER_VERBOSE environment
              variable, see its description below for details.
              Available levels:

       --nnooccoonnffiigg <<ooppttiioonnss>>
              Do not parse selected configuration files.
              _N_O_T_E_: If -include or -use-filedir-conf options are specified  at
              the command line, they will be honoured.

              Available options are:
                 all

       --qquuiieett
              Make  console  output  less verbose; in particular, prevents the
              status line (i.e. A:   0.7 V:   0.6 A-V:  0.068 ...) from  being
              displayed.  Particularly useful on slow terminals or broken ones
              which do not properly handle carriage return (i.e. \r).

              Set process priority for MPlayer  according  to  the  predefined
              priorities available under Windows and OS/2.  Possible values of
              <prio>:
                 idle|belownormal|normal|abovenormal|high|realtime

              _W_A_R_N_I_N_G_: Using realtime priority can cause system lockup.

              Display  even  less output and status messages than with -quiet.
              Also suppresses the GUI error message boxes.

       --sshhooww--pprrooffiillee <<pprrooffiillee>>

       --uussee--ffiilleeddiirr--ccoonnff
              Look for a file-specific configuration file in the same directo-
              ry as the file that is being played.
              _W_A_R_N_I_N_G_: May be dangerous if playing from untrusted media.

       --vv
              Increment  verbosity  level,  one level for each -v found on the
              command line.

              Dynamically changes the level of postprocessing depending on the
              available  spare  CPU  time.  The number you specify will be the
              maximum level used.  Usually you can use some big  number.   You
              have  to  use  -vf [s]pp without parameters in order for this to
              work.

       --aauuttoossyynncc <<ffaaccttoorr>>
              Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based  on  audio  delay  measure-
              ments.   Specifying  -autosync  0, the default, will cause frame
              timing to be based entirely on audio delay measurements.  Speci-
              fying  -autosync  1 will do the same, but will subtly change the
              A/V correction algorithm.  An uneven video framerate in a  movie
              which  plays  fine  with -nosound can often be helped by setting
              this to an integer value greater than 1.  The higher the  value,
              the  closer the timing will be to -nosound.  Try -autosync 30 to
              smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not implement  a
              perfect  audio delay measurement.  With this value, if large A/V
              sync offsets occur, they will only take about 1 or 2 seconds  to
              settle  out.   This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets
              should be the only side-effect of turning this  option  on,  for
              all sound drivers.

       --bbeenncchhmmaarrkk
              Prints  some  statistics  on CPU usage and dropped frames at the
              end of playback.  Use in combination with -nosound and -vo  null
              for benchmarking only the video codec.
              _N_O_T_E_:  With  this option MPlayer will also ignore frame duration
              when playing only video (you can think of that as infinite fps).

       --ccoolloorrkkeeyy <<nnuummbbeerr>>
              Changes  the  colorkey to an RGB value of your choice.  0x000000
              is black and 0xffffff is white.  Only supported by  the  cvidix,
              fbdev,  svga,  vesa,  winvidix, xmga, xvidix, xover, xv (see -vo
              xv:ck), xvmc (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       --nnooccoolloorrkkeeyy
              Disables colorkeying.  Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev,  sv-
              ga,  vesa,  winvidix,  xmga,  xvidix, xover, xv (see -vo xv:ck),
              xvmc (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

              Switches MPlayer to an experimental mode  where  timestamps  for
              video  frames are calculated differently and video filters which
              add new frames or modify timestamps of existing  ones  are  sup-
              ported.  The more accurate timestamps can be visible for example
              when playing subtitles timed to scene changes with the -ass  op-
              tion.   Without  -correct-pts the subtitle timing will typically
              be off by some frames.  This option does not work correctly with
              some demuxers and codecs.

       --ccrraasshh--ddeebbuugg ((DDEEBBUUGG CCOODDEE))
              Automatically  attaches gdb upon crash or SIGTRAP.  Support must
              be compiled in by configuring with --enable-crash-debug.

       --ddoouubblleecclliicckk--ttiimmee
              Time in milliseconds to recognize two consecutive button presses
              as  a double-click (default: 300).  Set to 0 to let your window-
              ing system decide what a double-click is (-vo directx only).
              _N_O_T_E_: You will get slightly  different  behaviour  depending  on
              whether you bind MOUSE_BTN0_DBL or MOUSE_BTN0-MOUSE_BTN0_DBL.

       --eeddlloouutt <<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Creates  a  new file and writes edit decision list (EDL) records
              to it.  During playback, the user hits 'i' to mark the start  or
              end  of a skip block.  This provides a starting point from which
              the user can fine-tune EDL entries later.  See http://www.mplay-
              erhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details.

       --eennqquueeuuee ((GGUUII oonnllyy))
              Enqueue  files given on the command line in the playlist instead
              of playing them immediately.

       --ffiixxeedd--vvoo
              Enforces a fixed video system for multiple files  (one  (un)ini-
              tialization  for  all files).  Therefore only one window will be
              opened for all  files.   Currently  the  following  drivers  are
              fixed-vo  compliant:  gl,  gl2, mga, svga, x11, xmga, xv, xvidix
              and dfbmga.

              Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/V sync  on  slow  sys-
              tems.   Video  filters  are  not applied to such frames.  For B-
              frames even decoding is skipped completely.

       --((nnoo))gguuii
              Enable or disable the GUI interface (default depends  on  binary
              name).   Only  works  as the first argument on the command line.
              Does not work as a config-file option.

       --hh,, --hheellpp,, ----hheellpp
              Show short summary of options.

              More intense frame dropping (breaks decoding).  Leads  to  image
              distortion!  Note that especially the libmpeg2 decoder may crash
              with this, so consider using "-vc ffmpeg12,".

       --hheeaarrttbbeeaatt--ccmmdd
              Command that is executed every 30 seconds  during  playback  via
              system() - i.e. using the shell.

              _N_O_T_E_: MPlayer uses this command without any checking, it is your
              responsibility to ensure it does  not  cause  security  problems
              (e.g. make sure to use full paths if "." is in your path like on
              Windows).  It also only works when playing video (i.e. not  with
              -novideo but works with -vo null).

              This  can  be "misused" to disable screensavers that do not sup-
              port the proper X API (also  see  -stop-xscreensaver).   If  you
              think this is too complicated, ask the author of the screensaver
              program to support the proper X APIs.

       --iiddeennttiiffyy
              Shorthand for -msglevel identify=4.  Show file parameters in  an
              easily  parseable format.  Also prints more detailed information
              about subtitle and audio track languages and IDs.  In some cases
              you can get more information by using -msglevel identify=6.  For
              example, for a DVD it will list the chapters and time length  of
              each  title,  as well as a disk ID.  Combine this with -frames 0
              to suppress all output.  The wrapper  script  TOOLS/midentify.sh
              suppresses the other MPlayer output and (hopefully) shellescapes
              the filenames.

       --iiddllee ((aallssoo sseeee --ssllaavvee))
              Makes MPlayer wait idly instead of quitting  when  there  is  no
              file  to play.  Mostly useful in slave mode where MPlayer can be
              controlled through input commands.

       --iinnppuutt <<ccoommmmaannddss>>
              This option can be used to configure certain parts of the  input
              system.  Paths are relative to ~/.mplayer/.
              _N_O_T_E_: Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.

              Available commands are:

                 conf=<filename>
                      Specify  input configuration file other than the default
                      ~/.mplayer/input.conf.  ~/.mplayer/<filename> is assumed
                      if no full path is given.
                 ar-dev=<device>
                      Device  to  be  used for Apple IR Remote (default is au-
                      todetected, Linux only).
                 ar-delay
                      Delay in milliseconds before we start  to  autorepeat  a

                      Use the key bindings that MPlayer ships with by default.
                 keylist
                      Prints all keys that can be bound to commands.
                 cmdlist
                      Prints all commands that can be bound to keys.
                 js-dev
                      Specifies  the joystick device to use (default: /dev/in-
                      put/js0).
                 file=<filename>
                      Read commands from the given file.  Mostly useful with a
                      FIFO.
                      _N_O_T_E_:  When  the given file is a FIFO MPlayer opens both
                      ends so you can do several 'echo "seek  10"  >  mp_pipe'
                      and the pipe will stay valid.

              Specify  the  size of the FIFO that buffers key events (default:
              7).  A FIFO of size n can buffer (n-1) events.   If  it  is  too
              small  some events may be lost (leading to "stuck mouse buttons"
              and similar effects).  If it is too big,  MPlayer  may  seem  to
              hang  while  it  processes the buffered events.  To get the same
              behavior as before this option was introduced, set it to  2  for
              Linux or 1024 for Windows.

              Prevent  MPlayer  from  reading  key events from standard input.
              Useful when reading data from standard input.  This is automati-
              cally  enabled  when  - is found on the command line.  There are
              situations where you have to set it manually, e.g. if  you  open
              /dev/stdin  (or  the  equivalent on your system), use stdin in a
              playlist or intend to read from stdin later on via the  loadfile
              or loadlist slave commands.

       --rrttcc ((RRTTCC oonnllyy))
              Turns on usage of the Linux RTC (realtime clock -  /dev/rtc)  as
              timing  mechanism.   This wakes up the process every 1/1024 sec-
              onds to check the current time.  Useless with modern Linux  ker-
              nels  configured  for  desktop  use  as they already wake up the
              process with similar accuracy when using normal timed sleep.

       --ppllaayyiinngg--mmssgg <<ssttrriinngg>>

       --ssllaavvee ((aallssoo sseeee --iinnppuutt))
              Switches  on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend for
              other programs.  Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlay-
              er will read commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.
              _N_O_T_E_:  See  -input  cmdlist  for  a  list  of slave commands and
              DOCS/tech/slave.txt for their description.  Also,  this  is  not
              intended to disable other inputs, e.g. via the video window, use
              some other method like -input nodefault-binds:conf=/dev/null for
              that.

       --ssooffttsslleeeepp
              Time  frames  by repeatedly checking the current time instead of
              asking the kernel to wake up MPlayer at the correct time.   Use-
              ful  if  your  kernel timing is imprecise and you cannot use the
              RTC either.  Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.

       --sssstteepp <<sseecc>>
              Skip <sec> seconds after every frame.  The normal  framerate  of
              the  movie  is  kept, so playback is accelerated.  Since MPlayer
              can only seek to the next keyframe this may be inexact.

       --aa5522ddrrcc <<lleevveell>>
              Select the  Dynamic  Range  Compression  level  for  AC-3  audio
              streams.   <level> is a float value ranging from 0 to 1, where 0
              means no compression and 1 (which is  the  default)  means  full
              compression  (make  loud  passages  more silent and vice versa).
              This option only shows an effect if the AC-3 stream contains the
              required range compression information.

              VOB(AC-3):  128-159,  VOB(LPCM):  160-191,   MPEG-TS   17-8190).
              MPlayer  prints the available audio IDs when run in verbose (-v)
              mode.  When playing an MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/MEncoder will use
              the first program (if present) with the chosen audio stream.

              Select  audio  substream  channel.  Currently the valid range is
              0x55..0x75 and applies only to MPEG-TS when handled by  the  na-
              tive  demuxer  (not by libavformat).  The format type may not be
              correctly identified because of how this  information  (or  lack
              thereof)  is embedded in the stream, but it will demux correctly
              the audio streams when multiple substreams are present.  MPlayer
              prints the available substream IDs when run with -identify.

              Specify  a  priority  list of audio languages to use.  Different
              container formats employ different language codes.  DVDs use ISO
              639-1  two  letter language codes, Matroska, MPEG-TS and NUT use
              ISO 639-2 three letter language codes while OGM uses a free-form
              identifier.   MPlayer prints the available languages when run in
              verbose (-v) mode.

              Force  audio  demuxer type for -audiofile.  Use a '+' before the
              name to force it, this will skip some checks!  Give the  demuxer
              name  as  printed by -audio-demuxer help.  For backward compati-

              Specify the maximum bandwidth for network streaming (for servers
              that are able to send content in different bitrates).  Useful if
              you  want to watch live streamed media behind a slow connection.
              With Real RTSP streaming, it is also used to set the maximum de-
              livery  bandwidth allowing faster cache filling and stream dump-
              ing.

       --ccaacchhee <<kkBByytteess>>
              This option specifies how much memory (in kBytes)  to  use  when
              precaching a file or URL.  Especially useful on slow media.

              If a seek is to be made to a position within <percentage> of the
              cache  size from the current position, MPlayer will wait for the
              cache to be filled to this position  rather  than  performing  a
              stream seek (default: 50).

              This  option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature of
              MPlayer.

              Available options are:

                 speed=<value>
                      Set CD spin speed.

                 paranoia=<0-2>
                      Set paranoia level.  Values other than 0 seem  to  break
                      playback of anything but the first track.
                         0: disable checking (default)
                         1: overlap checking only
                         2: full data correction and verification

                 generic-dev=<value>
                      Use specified generic SCSI device.

                 sector-size=<value>
                      Set atomic read size.

                 overlap=<value>
                      Force  minimum  overlap  search  during  verification to
                      <value> sectors.

                 toc-bias
                      Assume that the beginning offset of track 1 as  reported
                      in  the  TOC  will  be addressed as LBA 0.  Some Toshiba
                      drives need this for getting track boundaries correct.

                 toc-offset=<value>
                      Add <value> sectors to the values reported when address-
                      ing tracks.  May be negative.

              Request  the  number of playback channels (default: 2).  MPlayer
              asks the decoder to decode the audio into as  many  channels  as
              specified.  Then it is up to the decoder to fulfill the require-
              ment.  This is usually only important when playing  videos  with
              AC-3  audio  (like DVDs).  In that case liba52 does the decoding
              by default and correctly downmixes the audio into the  requested
              number  of  channels.   To directly control the number of output
              channels independently of how many channels are decoded, use the
              channels filter.
              _N_O_T_E_:  This  option  is  honored  by codecs (AC-3 only), filters
              (surround) and audio output drivers (OSS at least).

              Available options are:

              Specify which chapter to start playing at.   Optionally  specify
              which chapter to end playing at (default: 1).

       --ccooookkiieess ((nneettwwoorrkk oonnllyy))
              Send cookies when making HTTP requests.

       --ccooookkiieess--ffiillee <<ffiilleennaammee>> ((nneettwwoorrkk oonnllyy))
              Read  HTTP  cookies  from  <filename>  (default: ~/.mozilla/ and
              ~/.netscape/) and skip reading from default locations.  The file
              is assumed to be in Netscape format.

       --ddeellaayy <<sseecc>>
              audio delay in seconds (positive or negative float value)
              Negative  values  delay the audio, and positive values delay the
              video.  Note that this is the exact opposite of the -audio-delay
              MEncoder option.
              _N_O_T_E_:  When  used  with MEncoder, this is not guaranteed to work
              correctly with -ovc copy; use -audio-delay instead.

       --iiggnnoorree--ssttaarrtt
              Ignore the specified starting time for streams in AVI files.  In
              MPlayer,  this nullifies stream delays in files encoded with the
              -audio-delay option.  During encoding, this option prevents MEn-
              coder  from  transferring original stream start times to the new
              file; the -audio-delay option is not affected.  Note  that  MEn-
              coder  sometimes  adjusts stream starting times automatically to
              compensate for anticipated decoding delays, so do not  use  this
              option for encoding without testing it first.

       --ddeemmuuxxeerr <<[[++]]nnaammee>>
              Force demuxer type.  Use a '+' before the name to force it, this
              will skip some checks!  Give the demuxer name as printed by -de-
              muxer  help.  For backward compatibility it also accepts the de-
              muxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.

       --dduummppaauuddiioo ((MMPPllaayyeerr oonnllyy))
              Dumps raw compressed audio stream to ./stream.dump (useful  with
              MPEG/AC-3,  in  most  other cases the resulting file will not be
              playable).  If you give more than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       --dduummppffiillee <<ffiilleennaammee>> ((MMPPllaayyeerr oonnllyy))
              Specify  which  file MPlayer should dump to.  Should be used to-
              gether with -dumpaudio / -dumpvideo / -dumpstream.

       --dduummppssttrreeaamm ((MMPPllaayyeerr oonnllyy))
              Dumps the raw stream to ./stream.dump.  Useful when ripping from
              DVD  or  network.   If  you  give  more  than one of -dumpaudio,
              -dumpvideo, -dumpstream on the command line only  the  last  one
              will work.

       --dduummppvviiddeeoo ((MMPPllaayyeerr oonnllyy))
              Dump  raw compressed video stream to ./stream.dump (not very us-
              able).  If you give more than  one  of  -dumpaudio,  -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       --ddvvbbiinn <<ooppttiioonnss>> ((DDVVBB oonnllyy))
              Pass  the following parameters to the DVB input module, in order
              to override the default ones:

                 card=<1-4>
                      Specifies using card number 1-4 (default: 1).
                 file=<filename>
                      Instructs MPlayer to read the channels list from  <file-
                      name>.         Default        is        ~/.mplayer/chan-
                      nels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc} (based on your  card  type)
                      or ~/.mplayer/channels.conf as a last resort.
                 timeout=<1-30>
                      Maximum  number of seconds to wait when trying to tune a
                      frequency before giving up (default: 30).

       --ddvvdd--ddeevviiccee <<ppaatthh ttoo ddeevviiccee>> ((DDVVDD oonnllyy))
              Specify the DVD device or  .iso  filename  (default:  /dev/dvd).
              You  can also specify a directory that contains files previously
              copied directly from a DVD (with e.g. vobcopy).

       --ddvvdd--ssppeeeedd <<ffaaccttoorr oorr ssppeeeedd iinn KKBB//ss>> ((DDVVDD oonnllyy))
              Try to limit DVD speed (default: 0, no change).  DVD base  speed
              is  about  1350KB/s,  so  a  8x  drive  can read at speeds up to
              10800KB/s.  Slower speeds make the drive more quiet, for  watch-
              ing  DVDs 2700KB/s should be quiet and fast enough.  MPlayer re-
              sets the speed to the drive default value on close.  Values less
              than  100  mean multiples of 1350KB/s, i.e. -dvd-speed 8 selects
              10800KB/s.
              _N_O_T_E_: You need write access to the  DVD  device  to  change  the
              speed.

       --ddvvddaannggllee <<aannggllee IIDD>> ((DDVVDD oonnllyy))
              Some  DVD  discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple
              angles.  Here you can tell MPlayer which angles to use (default:
              1).

       --eeddll <<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Enables edit decision list (EDL) actions during playback.  Video
              will be skipped over and audio will be muted and unmuted accord-
              ing  to  the entries in the given file.  See http://www.mplayer-
              hq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details on how to use this.

       --eennddppooss <<[[[[hhhh::]]mmmm::]]ssss[[..mmss]]||ssiizzee[[bb||kkbb||mmbb]]>> ((aallssoo sseeee --ssss aanndd --ssbb))
              Stop at given time or byte position.
              _N_O_T_E_: Byte position is enabled only for MEncoder and will not be
              accurate, as it can only stop at a frame boundary.  When used in
              conjunction with -ss option, -endpos time will shift forward  by
              seconds specified with -ss.

              _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_:
                 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 56 seconds.
                 -endpos 01:10:00
                      Stop at 1 hour 10 minutes.
                 -ss 10 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 1 minute 6 seconds.
                 -endpos 100mb
                      Encode only 100 MB.

       --ffoorrcceeiiddxx
              Force index rebuilding.  Useful for files with broken index (A/V
              desync, etc).  This will enable seeking in files  where  seeking
              was  not  possible.  You can fix the index permanently with MEn-
              coder (see the documentation).
              _N_O_T_E_: This option only works if the  underlying  media  supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       --ffppss <<ffllooaatt vvaalluuee>>
              Override video framerate.  Useful if the original value is wrong
              or missing.

       --ffrraammeess <<nnuummbbeerr>>
              Play/convert only first <number> frames, then quit.

       --hhrr--mmpp33--sseeeekk ((MMPP33 oonnllyy))
              Hi-res MP3 seeking.  Enabled when playing from an  external  MP3
              file,  as we need to seek to the very exact position to keep A/V
              sync.  Can be slow especially when seeking  backwards  since  it
              has  to rewind to the beginning to find an exact frame position.

       --iiddxx ((aallssoo sseeee --ffoorrcceeiiddxx))
              Rebuilds index of files if no index was found, allowing seeking.
              Useful with broken/incomplete downloads, or badly created files.
              _N_O_T_E_: This option only works if the  underlying  media  supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       --nnooiiddxx Skip  rebuilding  index  file.  MEncoder skips writing the index
              with this option.

       --iippvv44--oonnllyy--pprrooxxyy ((nneettwwoorrkk oonnllyy))
              Skip the proxy for IPv6 addresses.  It will still  be  used  for
              IPv4 connections.

       --llooaaddiiddxx <<iinnddeexx ffiillee>>
              The  file  from  which  to  read  the  video index data saved by
              -saveidx.  This index will be used for seeking,  overriding  any
              index  data  contained in the AVI itself.  MPlayer will not pre-
              vent you from loading an index file generated from  a  different
              AVI, but this is sure to cause unfavorable results.
              _N_O_T_E_:  This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML sup-
              port.

       --mmcc <<sseeccoonnddss//ffrraammee>>
              maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)

       --mmff <<ooppttiioonn11::ooppttiioonn22::......>>
              Used when decoding from multiple PNG or JPEG files.

              Available options are:

                 w=<value>
                      input file width (default: autodetect)
                 h=<value>
                      input file height (default: autodetect)
                 fps=<value>
                      output fps (default: 25)
                 type=<value>
                      input file type (available: jpeg, png, tga, sgi)

       --nnii ((AAVVII oonnllyy))
              Force usage of non-interleaved AVI  parser  (fixes  playback  of
              some bad AVI files).

       --nnoobbppss ((AAVVII oonnllyy))
              Do  not  use average byte/second value for A-V sync.  Helps with
              some AVI files with broken header.

       --nnooeexxttbbaasseedd
              Disables extension-based demuxer selection.   By  default,  when
              the  file  type  (demuxer) cannot be detected reliably (the file
              has no header or it is not reliable enough), the filename exten-
              sion  is  used to select the demuxer.  Always falls back on con-
              tent-based demuxer selection.

       --ppaasssswwdd <<ppaasssswwoorrdd>> ((aallssoo sseeee --uusseerr)) ((nneettwwoorrkk oonnllyy))
              Specify password for HTTP authentication.

       --pprreeffeerr--iippvv44 ((nneettwwoorrkk oonnllyy))
              Use IPv4 on network connections.  Falls back on  IPv6  automati-
              cally.

       --pprreeffeerr--iippvv66 ((IIPPvv66 nneettwwoorrkk oonnllyy))
              Use  IPv6  on network connections.  Falls back on IPv4 automati-
              cally.

       --ppsspprroobbee <<bbyyttee ppoossiittiioonn>>
              When playing an MPEG-PS or MPEG-PES streams,  this  option  lets
              you  specify  how  many  bytes in the stream you want MPlayer to
              scan in order to identify the video codec used.  This option  is
              needed to play EVO or VDR files containing H.264 streams.

       --ppvvrr <<ooppttiioonn11::ooppttiioonn22::......>> ((PPVVRR oonnllyy))
              This option tunes various encoding properties of the PVR capture
              module.  It has to be used with any hardware MPEG encoder  based
              card   supported  by  the  V4L2  driver.   The  Hauppauge  WinTV
              PVR-150/250/350/500 and all IVTV based cards are  known  as  PVR
              capture cards.  Be aware that only Linux 2.6.18 kernel and above
              is able to handle MPEG stream through V4L2 layer.  For  hardware
              capture of an MPEG stream and watching it with MPlayer/MEncoder,
              use 'pvr://' as a movie URL.

              Available options are:

                 aspect=<0-3>
                      Specify input aspect ratio:
                         0: 1:1
                         1: 4:3 (default)
                         2: 16:9
                         3: 2.21:1

                 arate=<32000-48000>
                      Specify encoding audio rate (default: 48000  Hz,  avail-
                      able: 32000, 44100 and 48000 Hz).

                 alayer=<1-3>
                      Specify MPEG audio layer encoding (default: 2).

                 abitrate=<32-448>
                      Specify audio encoding bitrate in kbps (default: 384).

                 amode=<value>
                      Specify  audio  encoding  mode.  Available preset values
                      are 'stereo', 'joint_stereo',  'dual'  and  'mono'  (de-
                      fault: stereo).

                 vbitrate=<value>
                      Specify average video bitrate encoding in Mbps (default:
                      6).

                 vmode=<value>
                      Specify video encoding mode:
                         vbr: Variable BitRate (default)
                         cbr: Constant BitRate

                 vpeak=<value>
                      Specify peak video bitrate encoding in Mbps (only useful
                      for VBR encoding, default: 9.6).

                 fmt=<value>
                      Choose an MPEG format for encoding:
                         ps:    MPEG-2 Program Stream (default)
                         ts:    MPEG-2 Transport Stream

              These  options  set various parameters of the radio capture mod-
              ule.  For listening to radio with MPlayer use 'radio://<frequen-
              cy>' (if channels option is not given) or 'radio://<channel_num-
              ber>' (if channels option is given) as a movie URL.  You can see
              allowed  frequency range by running MPlayer with '-v'.  To start
              the grabbing subsystem, use 'radio://<frequency or channel>/cap-
              ture'.   If  the  capture keyword is not given you can listen to
              radio using the line-in cable only.  Using capture to listen  is
              not  recommended  due  to  synchronization problems, which makes
              this process uncomfortable.

              Available options are:

                 device=<value>
                      Radio device to use (default: /dev/radio0 for Linux  and
                      /dev/tuner0 for *BSD).

                 driver=<value>
                      Radio  driver to use (default: v4l2 if available, other-
                      wise v4l).  Currently, v4l and v4l2 drivers are support-
                      ed.

                 volume=<0..100>
                      sound volume for radio device (default 100)

                 freq_min=<value> (*BSD BT848 only)
                      minimum allowed frequency (default: 87.50)

                 freq_max=<value> (*BSD BT848 only)
                      maximum allowed frequency (default: 108.00)

                 channels=<frequency>-<name>,<frequency>-<name>,...
                      Set  channel  list.   Use _ for spaces in names (or play
                      with quoting ;-).  The channel names will then be  writ-
                      ten  using OSD and the slave commands radio_step_channel
                      and radio_set_channel will be usable for a  remote  con-
                      trol  (see LIRC).  If given, number in movie URL will be
                      treated as channel position in channel list.
                      _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_: radio://1, radio://104.4, radio_set_channel 1

                 adevice=<value> (radio capture only)
                      Name of device to capture sound from.   Without  such  a
                      name  capture will be disabled, even if the capture key-
                      word appears in the URL.  For ALSA devices use it in the
                      form  hw=<card>.<device>.  If the device name contains a
                      '=', the module will use ALSA to capture, otherwise OSS.

                 arate=<value> (radio capture only)
                      Rate in samples per second (default: 44100).
                      _N_O_T_E_:  When  using  audio  capture  set  also  -rawaudio
                      rate=<value> option with the same value  as  arate.   If
                      you  have  problems with sound speed (runs too quickly),
                      try  to  play   with   different   rate   values   (e.g.
                      48000,44100,32000,...).

                 achannels=<value> (radio capture only)
                      Number of audio channels to capture.

              This option lets you play raw audio files.  You have to use -de-
              muxer rawaudio as well.  It may also be used to play  audio  CDs
              which are not 44kHz 16-bit stereo.  For playing raw AC-3 streams
              use -rawaudio format=0x2000 -demuxer rawaudio.

              This option lets you play raw video files.  You have to use -de-
              muxer rawvideo as well.

              Available options are:

                 fps=<value>
                      rate in frames per second (default: 25.0)

       --rrttsspp--ppoorrtt
              Used with 'rtsp://' URLs to  force  the  client's  port  number.
              This option may be useful if you are behind a router and want to
              forward the RTSP stream from the server to a specific client.

       --rrttsspp--ddeessttiinnaattiioonn
              Used with 'rtsp://' URLs to force the destination IP address  to
              be bound.  This option may be useful with some RTSP server which
              do not send RTP packets to the right interface.  If the  connec-
              tion  to  the  RTSP server fails, use -v to see which IP address
              MPlayer tries to bind to and try to force it to one assigned  to
              your computer instead.

       --rrttsspp--ssttrreeaamm--oovveerr--ttccpp ((LLIIVVEE555555 aanndd NNEEMMEESSII oonnllyy))
              Used  with 'rtsp://' URLs to specify that the resulting incoming
              RTP and RTCP packets be streamed over TCP (using  the  same  TCP
              connection  as  RTSP).   This option may be useful if you have a
              broken internet connection that does not pass incoming UDP pack-
              ets (see http://www.live555.com/mplayer/).

       --ssaavveeiiddxx <<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Force  index  rebuilding and dump the index to <filename>.  Cur-
              rently this only works with AVI files.
              _N_O_T_E_: This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML  sup-
              port.

       --ssbb <<bbyyttee ppoossiittiioonn>> ((aallssoo sseeee --ssss))
              Seek  to  byte position.  Useful for playback from CD-ROM images
              or VOB files with junk at the beginning.

       --ssppeeeedd <<00..0011--110000>>
              Slow down or speed up playback by the factor given as parameter.
              Not guaranteed to work correctly with -oac copy.

       --ssrraattee <<HHzz>>
              Selects the output sample rate to be used (of course sound cards
              have limits on this).  If the sample frequency selected is  dif-
              ferent  from  that of the current media, the resample or lavcre-
              sample audio filter will be inserted into the audio filter layer
              to compensate for the difference.  The type of resampling can be
              controlled by the -af-adv option.  The default  is  fast  resam-
              pling that may cause distortion.

       --ssss <<ttiimmee>> ((aallssoo sseeee --ssbb))
              Seek to given time position.

              _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_:
                 -ss 56
                      Seeks to 56 seconds.
                 -ss 01:10:00
                      Seeks to 1 hour 10 min.

       --ttsskkeeeeppbbrrookkeenn
              Tells  MPlayer  not  to discard TS packets reported as broken in
              the stream.  Sometimes needed to play corrupted MPEG-TS files.

       --ttsspprroobbee <<bbyyttee ppoossiittiioonn>>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, this option lets you specify how
              many  bytes in the stream you want MPlayer to search for the de-
              sired audio and video IDs.

       --ttsspprroogg <<11--6655553344>>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, you can specify with this option
              which  program  (if present) you want to play.  Can be used with
              -vid and -aid.

       --ttvv <<ooppttiioonn11::ooppttiioonn22::......>> ((TTVV//PPVVRR oonnllyy))
              This option tunes various properties of the TV  capture  module.
              For watching TV with MPlayer, use 'tv://' or 'tv://<channel_num-
              ber>' or even  'tv://<channel_name>  (see  option  channels  for
              channel_name   below)   as  a  movie  URL.   You  can  also  use
              'tv:///<input_id>' to start watching a movie from a composite or
              S-Video input (see option input for details).

              Available options are:

                 noaudio
                      no sound

                 automute=<0-255> (v4l and v4l2 only)
                      If  signal strength reported by device is less than this
                      value, audio and video will be muted.  In most cases au-
                      tomute=100  will be enough.  Default is 0 (automute dis-
                      abled).

                 driver=<value>
                      See -tv driver=help for a list of compiled-in  TV  input
                      drivers.   available:  dummy,  v4l,  v4l2, bsdbt848 (de-
                      fault: autodetect)

                 device=<value>
                      Specify TV device (default: /dev/video0).  _N_O_T_E_: For the
                      bsdbt848  driver you can provide both bktr and tuner de-
                      vice names separating them with a comma, tuner after bk-
                      tr (e.g. -tv device=/dev/bktr1,/dev/tuner1).

                 input=<value>
                      Specify  input  (default: 0 (TV), see console output for
                      available inputs).

                 freq=<value>
                      Specify  the  frequency  to  set  the  tuner  to   (e.g.
                      511.250).  Not compatible with the channels parameter.

                 outfmt=<value>
                      Specify  the  output  format  of the tuner with a preset
                      value supported by the V4L driver (yv12,  rgb32,  rgb24,
                      rgb16,  rgb15,  uyvy, yuy2, i420) or an arbitrary format
                      given as hex value.  Try outfmt=help for a list  of  all
                      available formats.

                 width=<value>
                      output window width

                 height=<value>
                      output window height

                 fps=<value>
                      framerate at which to capture video (frames per second)

                 buffersize=<value>
                      maximum  size  of  the  capture buffer in megabytes (de-
                      fault: dynamical)

                 norm=<value>
                      For bsdbt848 and v4l, PAL, SECAM,  NTSC  are  available.
                      For  v4l2,  see  the  console  output  for a list of all
                      available norms, also see the normid option below.

                 normid=<value> (v4l2 only)
                      Sets the TV norm to the given numeric ID.  The  TV  norm
                      depends on the capture card.  See the console output for
                      a list of available TV norms.

                 channel=<value>
                      Set tuner to <value> channel.

                 chanlist=<value>
                      available: europe-east, europe-west, us-bcast, us-cable,
                      etc

                 channels=<chan>-<name>[=<norm>],<chan>-<name>[=<norm>],...
                      Set  names  for channels.  _N_O_T_E_: If <chan> is an integer
                      greater than 1000, it will be treated as  frequency  (in
                      kHz) rather than channel name from frequency table.
                      Use  _  for  spaces  in names (or play with quoting ;-).
                      The channel names will then be written  using  OSD,  and
                      the  slave  commands tv_step_channel, tv_set_channel and
                      tv_last_channel will be usable for a remote control (see
                      LIRC).  Not compatible with the frequency parameter.
                      _N_O_T_E_:  The  channel  number will then be the position in
                      the 'channels' list, beginning with 1.
                      _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_:    tv://1,    tv://TV1,    tv_set_channel    1,

                 [brightness|contrast|hue|saturation]=<-100-100>
                      Set the image equalizer on the card.

                 audiorate=<value>
                      Set audio capture bitrate.

                 forceaudio
                      Capture audio even if there are no audio sources report-
                      ed by v4l.

                 alsa
                      Capture from ALSA.

                 amode=<0-3>
                      Choose an audio mode:
                         0: mono
                         1: stereo
                         2: language 1
                         3: language 2

                 forcechan=<1-2>
                      By default, the count of recorded audio channels is  de-
                      termined  automatically  by querying the audio mode from
                      the TV card.  This  option  allows  forcing  stereo/mono
                      recording  regardless of the amode option and the values
                      returned by v4l.  This can be used  for  troubleshooting
                      when  the  TV card is unable to report the current audio
                      mode.

                 adevice=<value>
                      Set an audio device.  <value> should be /dev/xxx for OSS
                      and a hardware ID for ALSA.  You must replace any ':' by
                      a '.' in the hardware ID for ALSA.

                 audioid=<value>
                      Choose an audio output of the capture card,  if  it  has
                      more than one.

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=<0-65535> (v4l1)

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=<0-100> (v4l2)
                      These  options  set parameters of the mixer on the video
                      capture card.  They will have no effect,  if  your  card
                      does not have one.  For v4l2 50 maps to the default val-
                      ue of the control, as reported by the driver.

                 gain=<0-100> (v4l2)
                      Set gain control for video devices (usually webcams)  to
                      the  desired  value and switch off automatic control.  A
                      value of 0 enables automatic control.  If this option is
                      omitted, gain control will not be modified.

                 immediatemode=<bool>
                      A  value  of  0 means capture and buffer audio and video
                      together (default for MEncoder).  A value of 1  (default
                      for  MPlayer) means to do video capture only and let the
                      audio go through a loopback cable from the  TV  card  to
                      the sound card.

                 mjpeg
                      Use  hardware  MJPEG  compression  (if the card supports
                      it).  When using this option, you do not need to specify
                      the  width  and  height  of  the  output window, because
                      MPlayer will determine it automatically from the decima-
                      tion value (see below).

                 decimation=<1|2|4>
                      choose  the  size of the picture that will be compressed
                      by hardware MJPEG compression:
                         1: full size
                             704x576    PAL

                             352x288    PAL
                             352x240    NTSC
                         4: small size
                             176x144    PAL
                             176x120    NTSC

                 quality=<0-100>
                      Choose the quality of the JPEG compression (< 60  recom-
                      mended for full size).

                 tdevice=<value>
                      Specify  TV  teletext  device  (example: /dev/vbi0) (de-
                      fault: none).

                 tformat=<format>
                      Specify TV teletext display format (default: 0):
                         0: opaque
                         1: transparent
                         2: opaque with inverted colors
                         3: transparent with inverted colors

                 tpage=<100-899>
                      Specify initial TV teletext page number (default:  100).

                 tlang=<-1-127>
                      Specify  default  teletext  language  code (default: 0),
                      which will be used as primary language until a  type  28
                      packet is received.  Useful when the teletext system us-
                      es a non-latin character set, but language codes are not
                      transmitted  via  teletext type 28 packets for some rea-
                      son.  To see a list of supported language codes set this
                      option to -1.

                 hidden_video_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate  stream  with  video  renderer instead of Null
                      renderer (default: off).  Will help if video freezes but
                      audio does not.  _N_O_T_E_: May not work with -vo directx and
                      -vf crop combination.

                 hidden_vp_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate VideoPort pin stream with video  renderer  in-
                      stead  of  removing  it  from  the graph (default: off).
                      Useful if your card has a VideoPort  pin  and  video  is
                      choppy.   _N_O_T_E_:  May  not  work with -vo directx and -vf
                      crop combination.

                 system_clock (dshow only)
                      Use the system clock as sync source instead of  the  de-
                      fault  graph  clock  (usually  the clock from one of the
                      live sources in graph).

                 normalize_audio_chunks (dshow only)
                      Create audio chunks with a time length  equal  to  video
                      frame time length (default: off).  Some audio cards cre-
                      ate audio chunks about 0.5s in size, resulting in choppy
                      video when using immediatemode=0.

              Tune  the TV channel scanner.  MPlayer will also print value for
              "-tv channels=" option, including existing and just found  chan-
              nels.

              Available suboptions are:

                 autostart
                      Begin  channel  scanning  immediately after startup (de-
                      fault: disabled).

                 period=<0.1-2.0>
                      Specify delay in seconds before switching to next  chan-
                      nel  (default:  0.5).   Lower  values  will cause faster
                      scanning, but can detect inactive TV channels as active.

                 threshold=<1-100>
                      Threshold value for the signal strength (in percent), as
                      reported by the device (default: 50).  A signal strength
                      higher  than this value will indicate that the currently
                      scanning channel is active.

              Turn  on  SSA/ASS  subtitle rendering.  With this option, libass
              will be used for SSA/ASS external subtitles and Matroska tracks.
              You may also want to use -embeddedfonts.

       Audio output drivers are interfaces to different audio  output  facili-
       ties.  The syntax is:

       --aaoo <<ddrriivveerr11[[::ssuubbooppttiioonn11[[==vvaalluuee]]::......]],,ddrriivveerr22,,......[[,,]]>>
              Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used.

       If  the  list  has a trailing ',' MPlayer will fall back on drivers not
       contained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omit-
       ted.

              Adjust where the output is on the screen initially.  The x and y
              specifications  are  in pixels measured from the top-left of the
              screen to the top-left of the image being displayed, however  if
              a percentage sign is given after the argument it turns the value
              into a percentage of the screen size in that direction.  It also
              supports the standard X11 -geometry option format.  If an exter-
              nal window is specified using the -wid option, then the x and  y
              coordinates  are  relative  to the top-left corner of the window
              rather than the screen.  The coordinates  are  relative  to  the
              screen  given  with -xineramascreen for the video output drivers
              that fully support -xineramascreen (direct3d,  gl,  gl2,  vdpau,
              x11, xv, xvmc).
              _N_O_T_E_:  This option is only supported by the x11, xmga, xv, xvmc,
              xvidix, gl, gl2, directx, fbdev and tdfxfb video output drivers.

              This tells the GUI to also use an X11 window and stick itself to
              the bottom of the video, which is useful to embed a mini-GUI  in
              a browser (with the MPlayer plugin for instance).

       --hhuuee <<--110000--110000>>
              Adjust  the hue of the video signal (default: 0).  You can get a
              colored negative of the image with this option.   Not  supported
              by all video output drivers.

              Set the aspect ratio of your monitor or TV screen.  A value of 0
              disables a previous setting (e.g. in the  config  file).   Over-
              rides the -monitorpixelaspect setting if enabled.

              Set  the  aspect  of a single pixel of your monitor or TV screen
              (default: 1).  A value of 1 means  square  pixels  (correct  for
              (almost?) all LCDs).

       --nnooddoouubbllee
              Disables  double buffering, mostly for debugging purposes.  Dou-
              ble buffering fixes flicker by storing two frames in memory, and
              displaying  one while decoding another.  It can affect OSD nega-
              tively, but often removes OSD flickering.

       --nnooggrraabbppooiinntteerr
              Do not grab the mouse pointer after a video mode  change  (-vm).
              Useful for multihead setups.

       --nnookkeeeeppaassppeecctt
              Do  not  keep  window  aspect ratio when resizing windows.  Only
              works with the x11, xv, xmga, xvidix, directx video output driv-
              ers.   Furthermore  under  X11  your window manager has to honor
              window aspect hints.

       --oonnttoopp
              Makes the player window stay on top of other windows.  Supported
              by  video  output  drivers which use X11, except SDL, as well as
              directx, macosx, quartz, ggi and gl2.

       --ppaannssccaann <<00..00--11..00>>
              Enables pan-and-scan functionality (cropping the sides of e.g. a
              16:9  movie  to  make it fit a 4:3 display without black bands).
              The range controls how much of the image is cropped.  Only works
              with the xv, xmga, mga, gl, gl2, quartz, macosx and xvidix video
              output drivers.
              _N_O_T_E_: Values between -1 and 0 are allowed as  well,  but  highly
              experimental and may crash or worse.  Use at your own risk!

              Change the range of the pan-and-scan functionality (default: 1).
              Positive values mean multiples of the default  range.   Negative
              numbers  mean you can zoom in up to a factor of -panscanrange+1.
              E.g. -panscanrange -3 allows a zoom factor of  up  to  4.   This
              feature  is experimental.  Do not report bugs unless you are us-
              ing -vo gl.

       --rreeffrreesshhrraattee <<HHzz>>
              Set the monitor refreshrate in Hz.  Currently only supported  by
              -vo directx combined with the -vm option.

       --rroooottwwiinn
              Play  movie  in  the  root window (desktop background).  Desktop
              background images may cover  the  movie  window,  though.   Only
              works with the x11, xv, xmga, xvidix, quartz, macosx and directx
              video output drivers.

       --ssaattuurraattiioonn <<--110000--110000>>
              Adjust the saturation of the video signal (default: 0).  You can
              get  grayscale  output  with  this option.  Not supported by all
              video output drivers.

       --ssccrreeeennhh <<ppiixxeellss>>
              Specify the screen height for video output drivers which do  not

              Turns off xscreensaver at startup and turns it on again on exit.
              If  your  screensaver supports neither the XSS nor XResetScreen-
              Saver API please use -heartbeat-cmd instead.

       --vvmm
              Try to change to a different video mode.  Supported by the  dga,
              x11, xv, sdl and directx video output drivers.  If used with the
              directx video output driver the  -screenw,  -screenh,  -bpp  and
              -refreshrate options can be used to set the new display mode.

       --vvssyynncc
              Enables  VBI for the vesa, dfbmga and svga video output drivers.

              This tells MPlayer to attach to an existing window.   Useful  to
              embed MPlayer in a browser (e.g. the plugger extension).

       --xxiinneerraammaassccrreeeenn <<--22--......>>
              In  Xinerama  configurations  (i.e.  a single desktop that spans
              across multiple displays) this option tells MPlayer which screen
              to  display the movie on.  A value of -2 means fullscreen across
              the whole virtual display (in this case Xinerama information  is
              completely ignored), -1 means fullscreen on the display the win-
              dow currently is on.  The initial position set via the -geometry
              option  is  relative to the specified screen.  Will usually only
              work with "-fstype -fullscreen" or "-fstype none".  This  option
              is  not suitable to only set the startup screen (because it will
              always display on the given screen in fullscreen mode),  -geome-
              try  is  the  best that is available for that purpose currently.
              Supported by at least the direct3d, gl, gl2, x11  and  xv  video
              output drivers.

              Select a part of the input image  to  display,  multiple  occur-
              rences of this option switch on cinerama mode.  In cinerama mode
              the movie is distributed over more than one TV  (or  beamer)  to
              create a larger image.  Options appearing after the n-th -zrcrop
              apply to the n-th MJPEG card, each card should at least  have  a
              -zrdev in addition to the -zrcrop.  For examples, see the output
              of -zrhelp and the Zr section of the documentation.

              Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ',' MPlayer will fall back  on  drivers  not
       contained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omit-

       ggll
              OpenGL  video output driver, simple version.  Video size must be
              smaller than the maximum texture size of your OpenGL implementa-
              tion.   Intended  to work even with the most basic OpenGL imple-
              mentations, but also makes use of newer extensions, which  allow
              support  for more colorspaces and direct rendering.  For optimal
              speed try something similar to
              -vo gl:yuv=2:rectangle=2:force-pbo:ati-hack -dr -noslices
              The code performs very few checks, so  if  a  feature  does  not
              work,  this  might  be  because  it  is  not  supported  by your
              card/OpenGL implementation even if you do not get any error mes-
              sage.   Use  glxinfo  or a similar tool to display the supported
              OpenGL extensions.
                 (no)ati-hack
                      ATI drivers may give a corrupted  image  when  PBOs  are
                      used  (when  using -dr or force-pbo).  This option fixes
                      this, at the expense of using a bit more memory.
                 (no)force-pbo
                      Always uses PBOs to transfer textures even if  this  in-
                      volves an extra copy.  Currently this gives a little ex-
                      tra speed with NVidia drivers and a lot more speed  with
                      ATI drivers.  May need -noslices and the ati-hack subop-
                      tion to work correctly.
                 (no)scaled-osd
                      Changes the way the OSD behaves when  the  size  of  the
                      window  changes  (default:  disabled).  When enabled be-
                      haves more like the other video output drivers, which is
                      better for fixed-size fonts.  Disabled looks much better
                      with FreeType fonts and uses the borders  in  fullscreen
                      mode.   Does  not work correctly with ass subtitles (see
                      -ass), you can instead render them without  OpenGL  sup-
                      port via -vf ass.
                 osdcolor=<0xAARRGGBB>
                      Color  for OSD (default: 0x00ffffff, corresponds to non-
                      transparent white).
                 rectangle=<0,1,2>
                      Select usage of rectangular textures which  saves  video
                      RAM, but often is slower (default: 0).
                         0: Use power-of-two textures (default).
                         1: Use the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension.
                         2: Use the GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two extension.
                         In some cases only supported  in  software  and  thus
                         very slow.
                 swapinterval=<n>
                      Minimum  interval  between  two buffer swaps, counted in
                      displayed frames (default: 1).  1 is equivalent  to  en-
                      abling VSYNC, 0 to disabling VSYNC.  Values below 0 will
                      leave it at the system default.  This limits the framer-
                      ate   to   (horizontal  refresh  rate  /  n).   Requires
                      GLX_SGI_swap_control  support  to   work.    With   some
                      (most/all?)   implementations   this   only   works   in
                      fullscreen mode.
                 yuv=<n>
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion.
                         0: Use  software  conversion  (default).   Compatible
                         with  all OpenGL versions.  Provides brightness, con-
                         trast and saturation control.
                         1: Use register combiners.  This uses an  nVidia-spe-
                         cific extension (GL_NV_register_combiners).  At least
                         three texture units are needed.  Provides  saturation
                         and hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         2:  Use  a  fragment program.  Needs the GL_ARB_frag-
                         ment_program extension and  at  least  three  texture
                         units.  Provides brightness, contrast, saturation and
                         hue control.
                         3: Use a fragment program using the POW  instruction.
                         Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension and at
                         least three texture units.  Provides brightness, con-
                         trast,  saturation, hue and gamma control.  Gamma can
                         also be set independently for red,  green  and  blue.
                         Method 4 is usually faster.
                         4:  Use  a  fragment  program with additional lookup.
                         Needs the GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension  and  at
                         least  four texture units.  Provides brightness, con-
                         trast, saturation, hue and gamma control.  Gamma  can
                         also be set independently for red, green and blue.
                         5:  Use  ATI-specific method (for older cards).  This
                         uses an ATI-specific extension (GL_ATI_fragment_shad-
                         er  -  not  GL_ARB_fragment_shader!).  At least three
                         texture units are needed.   Provides  saturation  and
                         hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         6:  Use  a  3D  texture  to do conversion via lookup.
                         Needs the GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension  and  at
                         least  four  texture units.  Extremely slow (software
                         emulation) on some (all?) ATI cards since it  uses  a
                         texture  with  border  pixels.   Provides brightness,
                         contrast, saturation, hue and gamma  control.   Gamma
                         can  also  be  set  independently  for red, green and
                         blue.  Speed depends more  on  GPU  memory  bandwidth
                         than other methods.
                 ycbcr
                      Use  the  GL_MESA_ycbcr_texture extension to convert YUV
                      to RGB.  In most cases this is probably slower than  do-
                      ing software conversion to RGB.
                 lscale=<n>
                      Select  the  scaling function to use for luminance scal-
                      ing.  Only valid for yuv modes 2, 3, 4 and 6.
                         0: Use simple linear filtering (default).
                         1: Use bicubic B-spline filtering  (better  quality).
                         Needs  one additional texture unit.  Older cards will
                         not be able to handle this for  chroma  at  least  in
                         fullscreen mode.
                         2:  Use cubic filtering in horizontal, linear filter-
                         ing in vertical direction.  Works on a few more cards
                         than method 1.
                         3:  Same  as  1  but  does  not use a lookup texture.
                         Might be faster on some cards.
                         4: Use experimental unsharp masking with 3x3  support
                         and  a default strength of 0.5 (see filter-strength).
                         5: Use experimental unsharp masking with 5x5  support
                         and  a default strength of 0.5 (see filter-strength).
                 cscale=<n>
                      Select the scaling function to use for chrominance scal-
                      ing.  For details see lscale.
                 filter-strength=<value>
                      Set  the  effect  strength for the lscale/cscale filters
                      that support it.
                 customprog=<filename>
                      Load a custom fragment  program  from  <filename>.   See
                      TOOLS/edgedect.fp for an example.
                 customtex=<filename>
                      Load  a  custom  "gamma  ramp"  texture from <filename>.
                      This can be used in combination with yuv=4 or  with  the
                      customprog option.
                 (no)customtlin
                      If enabled (default) use GL_LINEAR interpolation, other-
                      wise use GL_NEAREST for customtex texture.
                 (no)customtrect
                      If enabled, use texture_rectangle for customtex texture.
                      Default is disabled.

              Normally  there  is no reason to use the following options, they
              mostly exist for testing purposes.

                 (no)glfinish
                      Call glFinish() before swapping buffers.  Slower but  in
                      some cases more correct output (default: disabled).
                 (no)manyfmts
                      Enables  support  for  more  (RGB and BGR) color formats
                      (default: enabled).  Needs OpenGL version >= 1.2.
                 slice-height=<0-...>
                      Number of lines copied to texture in one piece (default:
                      0).  0 for whole image.
                      _N_O_T_E_:  If  YUV  colorspace  is used (see yuv suboption),
                      special rules apply:
                         If the decoder uses slice rendering (see  -noslices),
                         this setting has no effect, the size of the slices as
                         provided by the decoder is used.
                         If the decoder does not use slice rendering, the  de-
                         fault is 16.
                 (no)osd
                      Enable  or  disable support for OSD rendering via OpenGL
                      (default: enabled).  This option is for testing; to dis-
                      able the OSD use -osdlevel 0 instead.
                 (no)aspect
                      Enable  or  disable aspect scaling and pan-and-scan sup-
                      port  (default:  enabled).   Disabling  might   increase
                      speed.

       ggll22
              Variant  of  the  OpenGL  video  output driver.  Supports videos
              larger than the maximum texture size but lacks many of  the  ad-
              vanced  features  and  optimizations of the gl driver and is un-
              likely to be extended further.
                 (no)glfinish
                      same as gl (default: enabled)
                 yuv=<n>
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB  conversion.   If  set  to
                      anything  except  0 OSD will be disabled and brightness,
                      contrast and gamma setting is  only  available  via  the
                      global  X  server  settings.  Apart from this the values
                      have the same meaning as for -vo gl.

       nnuullll
              Produces no video output.  Useful for benchmarking.

       aaaa
              ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.  You
              can get a list and an explanation of available suboptions by ex-
              ecuting 'mplayer -vo aa:help'.
              _N_O_T_E_: The driver does not handle -aspect correctly.
              _H_I_N_T_: You probably have  to  specify  -monitorpixelaspect.   Try
              'mplayer -vo aa -monitorpixelaspect 0.5'.

       ccaaccaa
              Color  ASCII  art  video output driver that works on a text con-
              sole.

       bbll
              Video playback using the Blinkenlights UDP protocol.  This driv-
              er is highly hardware specific.
                 <subdevice>
                      Explicitly  choose the Blinkenlights subdevice driver to
                      use.  It is something like arcade:host=localhost:2323 or
                      hdl:file=name1,file=name2.   You  must  specify a subde-
                      vice.

       ggggii
              GGI graphics system video output driver
                 <driver>
                      Explicitly choose the GGI driver to  use.   Replace  any
                      ',' that would appear in the driver string by a '.'.

       ddiirreeccttffbb
              Play video using the DirectFB library.
                 (no)input
                      Use  the  DirectFB  instead of the MPlayer keyboard code
                      (default: enabled).
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      Double and triple buffering give  best  results  if  you
                      want  to avoid tearing issues.  Triple buffering is more
                      efficient than double buffering as  it  does  not  block
                      MPlayer  while waiting for the vertical retrace.  Single
                      buffering should be avoided (default: single).
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      Control the output order for interlaced frames (default:
                      disabled).   Valid  values  are  top = top fields first,
                      bottom = bottom fields first.  This option does not have
                      any  effect  on progressive film material like most MPEG
                      movies are.  You need to enable this option if you  have
                      tearing  issues  or unsmooth motions watching interlaced
                      film material.
                 layer=N
                      Will force layer with ID N for playback (default:  -1  -
                      auto).
                 dfbopts=<list>
                      Specify a parameter list for DirectFB.

       ddffbbmmggaa
              Matrox G400/G450/G550 specific video output driver that uses the
              DirectFB library to make use of special hardware features.   En-
              ables CRTC2 (second head), displaying video independently of the
              first head.
                 (no)input
                      same as directfb (default: disabled)
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      same as directfb (default: triple)
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      same as directfb
                 (no)bes
                      Enable the use of the Matrox BES (backend  scaler)  (de-
                      fault:  disabled).   Gives  very good results concerning
                      speed and output quality as  interpolated  picture  pro-
                      cessing  is done in hardware.  Works only on the primary
                      head.
                 (no)spic
                      Make use of the Matrox sub picture layer to display  the
                      OSD (default: enabled).
                 (no)crtc2
                      Turn  on  TV-out  on the second head (default: enabled).
                      The output quality is amazing as it is a full interlaced
                      picture with proper sync to every odd/even field.
                 tvnorm=pal|ntsc|auto
                      Will set the TV norm of the Matrox card without the need
                      for  modifying  /etc/directfbrc   (default:   disabled).
                      Valid norms are pal = PAL, ntsc = NTSC.  Special norm is
                      auto (auto-adjust using  PAL/NTSC)  because  it  decides
                      which  norm  to  use  by looking at the framerate of the
                      movie.

       mmggaa ((LLiinnuuxx oonnllyy))
              Matrox specific video output driver that makes use  of  the  YUV
              back  end  scaler on Gxxx cards through a kernel module.  If you
              have a Matrox card, this is the fastest option.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the Matrox device  name  to  use  (de-
                      fault: /dev/mga_vid).

              S3 Virge specific video output driver.  This driver supports the
              card's  YUV  conversion and scaling, double buffering and direct
              rendering features.  Use -vf yuy2  to  get  hardware-accelerated
              YUY2 rendering, which is much faster than YV12 on this card.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the fbdev device name to use (default:
                      /dev/fb0).

       wwiiii ((LLiinnuuxx oonnllyy))
              Nintendo Wii/GameCube specific video output driver.

       33ddffxx ((LLiinnuuxx oonnllyy))
              3dfx-specific video output driver that directly uses  the  hard-

       ttddffxx__vviidd ((LLiinnuuxx oonnllyy))
              3dfx-specific video output driver that works in combination with
              the tdfx_vid kernel module.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the device name to use (default: /dev/

              The  format  is  the  same as the one employed by mjpegtools, so
              this is useful if you want to process the video with the  mjpeg-
              tools  suite.   It  supports  the YV12, RGB (24 bpp) and BGR (24
              bpp) format.  You can combine it with the  -fixed-vo  option  to
              concatenate files with the same dimensions and fps value.
                 interlaced
                      Write  the output as interlaced frames, top field first.
                 interlaced_bf
                      Write the output  as  interlaced  frames,  bottom  field

                      stream.yuv.

              _N_O_T_E_: If you do not specify any option the output is progressive
              (i.e. not interlaced).

       ggiiff8899aa
              Output each frame into a single animated GIF file in the current
              directory.  It supports only RGB format with 24 bpp and the out-

                 <fps>
                      Float value to specify framerate (default: 5.0).
                 <output>
                      Specify the output filename (default: ./out.gif).

              _N_O_T_E_:  You must specify the framerate before the filename or the
              framerate will be part of the filename.

                 outdir=<dirname>
                      Specify  the  directory  to  save the JPEG files to (de-
                      fault: ./).
                 subdirs=<prefix>
                      Create numbered subdirectories with the specified prefix
                      to save the files in instead of the current directory.
                 maxfiles=<value> (subdirs only)
                      Maximum  number  of  files to be saved per subdirectory.

       ppnnmm
              Output each frame into a PNM  file  in  the  current  directory.
              Each  file  takes  the frame number padded with leading zeros as
              name.  It supports PPM, PGM and PGMYUV files  in  both  raw  and
              ASCII mode.  Also see pnm(5), ppm(5) and pgm(5).
                 ppm
                      Write PPM files (default).
                 pgm

                 pgmyuv
                      Write  PGMYUV  files.   PGMYUV  is like PGM, but it also
                      contains the U and V plane, appended at  the  bottom  of
                      the picture.
                 raw
                      Write PNM files in raw mode (default).
                 ascii
                      Write PNM files in ASCII mode.
                 outdir=<dirname>
                      Specify the directory to save the PNM files to (default:
                      ./).
                 subdirs=<prefix>
                      Create numbered subdirectories with the specified prefix
                      to save the files in instead of the current directory.
                 maxfiles=<value> (subdirs only)
                      Maximum  number  of  files to be saved per subdirectory.
                      Must be equal to or larger than 1 (default: 1000).

       ppnngg
              Output each frame into a PNG  file  in  the  current  directory.
              Each  file  takes  the frame number padded with leading zeros as
              name.  24bpp RGB and BGR formats are supported.
                 z=<0-9>
                      Specifies the compression level.  0 is no compression, 9
                      is maximum compression.
                 outdir=<dirname>
                      Specify the directory to save the PNG files to (default:
                      ./).
                 alpha
                      Create PNG files  with  an  alpha  channel.   Note  that
                      MPlayer  in general does not support alpha, so this will
                      only be useful in some rare cases.

       ttggaa
              Output each frame into a Targa file in  the  current  directory.
              Each  file  takes  the frame number padded with leading zeros as
              name.  The purpose of this video output driver is to have a sim-
              ple  lossless  image writer to use without any external library.
              It supports the BGR[A] color format, with 15,  24  and  32  bpp.
              You  can force a particular format with the format video filter.

                      not supported by all codecs, and it will often result in
                      ugly artifacts.  This is not a bug, but a side effect of
                      not decoding at full resolution.

                 skiploopfilter=<skipvalue> (H.264 only)
                      Skips  the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during H.264 de-
                      coding.  Since the filtered frame is supposed to be used
                      as  reference  for  decoding dependent frames this has a
                      worse effect on quality than  not  doing  deblocking  on
                      e.g.  MPEG-2  video.  But at least for high bitrate HDTV
                      this provides a big  speedup  with  no  visible  quality
                      loss.

                      <skipvalue> can be either one of the following:
                         none: Never skip.
                         default:  Skip  useless processing steps (e.g. 0 size
                         packets in AVI).
                         nonref: Skip frames that are not referenced (i.e. not
                         used  for  decoding  other  frames,  the error cannot
                         "build up").
                         bidir: Skip B-Frames.
                         nonkey: Skip all frames except keyframes.
                         all: Skip all frames.

                 skipidct=<skipvalue> (MPEG-1/2 only)
                      Skips the IDCT step.  This degrades quality a lot of  in
                      almost  all cases (see skiploopfilter for available skip
                      values).

                 skipframe=<skipvalue>
                      Skips decoding of frames completely.  Big  speedup,  but
                      jerky  motion and sometimes bad artifacts (see skiploop-
                      filter for available skip values).

       Audio  filters allow you to modify the audio stream and its properties.
       The syntax is:

       --aaff <<ffiilltteerr11[[==ppaarraammeetteerr11::ppaarraammeetteerr22::......]],,ffiilltteerr22,,......>>
              Setup a chain of audio filters.

       Audio filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage
       the filter list.

              at 0, negative numbers address the end of the list  (-1  is  the
              last).

       --aaff--ccllrr

              Changes the sample rate of the audio stream.  Can be used if you
              have a fixed frequency sound card or if you are  stuck  with  an
              old sound card that is only capable of max 44.1kHz.  This filter
              is automatically enabled if necessary.  It only supports  16-bit
              integer and float in native-endian format as input.
              _N_O_T_E_: With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate <srate>.
                 <srate>
                      output sample frequency in Hz.  The valid range for this
                      parameter is 8000 to 192000.  If the  input  and  output
                      sample  frequency  are  the same or if this parameter is
                      omitted the filter is automatically  unloaded.   A  high
                      sample  frequency  normally  improves the audio quality,
                      especially when used in combination with other  filters.
                 <sloppy>
                      Allow (1) or disallow (0) the output frequency to differ
                      slightly from the frequency given by  <srate>  (default:
                      1).   Can  be used if the startup of the playback is ex-
                      tremely slow.
                 <type>
                      Selects which resampling method to use.
                         0: linear interpolation (fast, poor quality especial-
                         ly when upsampling)
                         1: polyphase filterbank and integer processing
                         2: polyphase filterbank and floating point processing
                         (slow, best quality)

              Encode multi-channel audio to AC-3 at runtime using  libavcodec.
              Supports  16-bit native-endian input format, maximum 6 channels.
              The output is big-endian when outputting a raw AC-3 stream,  na-
              tive-endian  when  outputting to S/PDIF.  The output sample rate
              of this filter is same with the input sample rate.   When  input
              sample  rate  is  48kHz, 44.1kHz, or 32kHz, this filter directly
              use it.  Otherwise a resampling filter is  auto-inserted  before
              this  filter  to make the input and output sample rate be 48kHz.
              You need to specify '-channels N' to make the decoder decode au-
              dio into N-channel, then the filter can encode the N-channel in-
              put to AC-3.
                 <tospdif>
                      Output raw AC-3 stream if zero or  not  set,  output  to
                      S/PDIF for passthrough when <tospdif> is set non-zero.
                 <bitrate>
                      The bitrate to encode the AC-3 stream.  Set it to either
                      384 or 384000 to get 384kbits.  Valid  values:  32,  40,
                      48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256,
                                    320,  384,  448, 512, 576, 640 Default bi-
                      trate is based on the input  channel  number:  1ch:  96,
                      2ch: 192,  3ch: 224,  4ch: 384,  5ch: 448,  6ch: 448
                 <minchn>
                      If  the  input channel number is less than <minchn>, the
                      filter will detach itself (default: 5).

              Remove  a sine at the specified frequency.  Useful to get rid of
              the 50/60Hz noise on low quality audio equipment.   It  probably
              only works on mono input.
                 <freq>
                      The  frequency  of  the sine which should be removed (in
                      Hz) (default: 50)
                 <decay>
                      Controls the adaptivity (a larger value  will  make  the
                      filter  adapt  to amplitude and phase changes quicker, a
                      smaller value will make the adaptation slower) (default:
                      0.0001).  Reasonable values are around 0.001.

              10 octave band graphic equalizer, implemented using 10 IIR  band
              pass  filters.  This means that it works regardless of what type
              of audio is being played back.  The center frequencies  for  the
              10 bands are:

              No. frequency
              0    31.25 Hz
              1    62.50 Hz

              8    8.00 kHz
              9   16.00 kHz

              If  the  sample rate of the sound being played is lower than the
              center frequency for a frequency band, then that  band  will  be
              disabled.  A known bug with this filter is that the characteris-
              tics for the uppermost band are not completely symmetric if  the
              sample rate is close to the center frequency of that band.  This
              problem can be worked around by upsampling the sound  using  the
              resample filter before it reaches this filter.

              (except mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono channel is re-

              Implements software volume control.  Use this filter  with  cau-
              tion since it can reduce the signal to noise ratio of the sound.
              In most cases it is best to set the level for the PCM  sound  to
              max,  leave this filter out and control the output level to your
              speakers with the master volume control of the mixer.   In  case
              your  sound  card  has  a digital PCM mixer instead of an analog
              one, and you hear distortion, use the MASTER mixer instead.   If
              there  is  an external amplifier connected to the computer (this
              is almost always the case), the noise level can be minimized  by
              adjusting  the master level and the volume knob on the amplifier
              until the hissing noise in the background is gone.
              This filter has a second feature: It measures the overall  maxi-
              mum  sound  level  and prints out that level when MPlayer exits.
              This volume estimate can be used for setting the sound level  in
              MEncoder such that the maximum dynamic range is utilized.
              _N_O_T_E_: This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only be en-
              abled once for every audio stream.
                 <v>
                      Sets the desired gain in dB  for  all  channels  in  the
                      stream  from  -200dB  to  +60dB,  where -200dB mutes the
                      sound completely and +60dB equals a gain  of  1000  (de-
                      fault: 0).
                 <sc>
                      Turns  soft  clipping  on (1) or off (0).  Soft-clipping
                      can make the sound more smooth if very high volume  lev-
                      els  are  used.  Enable this option if the dynamic range
                      of the loudspeakers is very low.

              Mixes channels arbitrarily.  Basically a combination of the vol-
              ume  and  the  channels filter that can be used to down-mix many
              channels to only a few, e.g. stereo to mono or vary the  "width"
              of  the  center speaker in a surround sound system.  This filter
              is hard to use, and will require some tinkering before  the  de-
              sired result is obtained.  The number of options for this filter
              depends on the number of output channels.   An  example  how  to
              downmix  a six-channel file to two channels with this filter can
              be found in the examples section near the end.

                      How much of input channel i is mixed into output channel
                      j  (0-1).  So in principle you first have n numbers say-
                      ing what to do with the first input channel, then n num-
                      bers  that  act on the second input channel etc.  If you
                      do not specify any numbers for some input channels, 0 is
                      assumed.

              Adds  a  subwoofer  channel to the audio stream.  The audio data
              used for creating the subwoofer channel is  an  average  of  the
              sound  in  channel 0 and channel 1.  The resulting sound is then
              low-pass filtered by a 4th order Butterworth filter with  a  de-
              fault  cutoff  frequency of 60Hz and added to a separate channel

                      the cutoff frequency as low as possible.  This will  im-
                      prove the stereo or surround sound experience.

              Decoder  for  matrix encoded surround sound like Dolby Surround.
              Many files with 2 channel audio actually contain  matrixed  sur-
              round  sound.  Requires a sound card supporting at least 4 chan-
              nels.
                 <delay>
                      delay time in ms for the rear speakers (0 to 1000)  (de-
                      fault: 20) This delay should be set as follows: If d1 is
                      the distance from the listening position  to  the  front
                      speakers and d2 is the distance from the listening posi-
                      tion to the rear speakers, then the delay should be  set
                      to 15ms if d1 <= d2 and to 15 + 5*(d1-d2) if d1 > d2.

       ddeellaayy[[==cchh11::cchh22::......]]
              Delays the sound to the loudspeakers such that  the  sound  from
              the  different channels arrives at the listening position simul-
              taneously.  It is only useful if you have more than 2 loudspeak-
              ers.
                 ch1,ch2,...
                      The  delay  in ms that should be imposed on each channel
                      (floating point number between 0 and 1000).

              To calculate the required delay for the different channels do as
              follows:

              1. Measure  the  distance to the loudspeakers in meters in rela-
                 tion to your listening position, giving you the distances  s1
                 to  s5 (for a 5.1 system).  There is no point in compensating
                 for the subwoofer (you will not hear the difference  anyway).

              2. Subtract  the  distances  s1 to s5 from the maximum distance,
                 i.e. s[i] = max(s) - s[i]; i = 1...5.

              3. Calculate the required delays in ms as d[i] =  1000*s[i]/342;
                 i = 1...5.

              Scales  audio tempo without altering pitch, optionally synced to
              playback speed (default).
              This works by playing 'stride' ms of audio at normal speed  then
              consuming  'stride*scale'  ms  of  input  audio.   It pieces the
              strides together by blending 'overlap'%  of  stride  with  audio
              following  the  previous stride.  It optionally performs a short
              statistical analysis on the next 'search' ms of audio to  deter-
              mine the best overlap position.
                 scale=<amount>
                      Nominal  amount  to  scale tempo.  Scales this amount in
                      addition to speed.  (default: 1.0)
                 stride=<amount>
                      Length in milliseconds to output each stride.  Too  high
                      of  value  will  cause  noticable  skips  at  high scale
                      amounts and an echo at low scale amounts.  Very low val-
                      ues  will alter pitch.  Increasing improves performance.
                      (default: 60)
                 overlap=<percent>
                      Percentage of stride to  overlap.   Decreasing  improves
                      performance.  (default: .20)
                 search=<amount>
                      Length  in milliseconds to search for best overlap posi-
                      tion.  Decreasing improves performance greatly.  On slow
                      systems,  you  will  probably want to set this very low.

                      dio tempo to match.

                      Would playback media at 1.2x normal speed, with audio at
                      normal pitch, but changing playback speed has no  effect
                      on audio tempo.

                      Would tweak the quality and performace parameters.
                 mplayer -af format=floatne,scaletempo media.ogg
                      Would  make  scaletempo use float code.  Maybe faster on
                      some platforms.
                 mplayer -af scaletempo=scale=1.2:speed=pitch audio.ogg
                      Would playback audio file at 1.2x normal speed, with au-
                      dio  at  normal  pitch.   Changing playback speed, would
                      change pitch, leaving audio tempo at 1.2x.

       ssttaattss
              Collects and prints statistics about the audio stream, especial-
              ly the volume.  These statistics are especially intended to help
              adjusting the volume while avoiding clipping.  The  volumes  are
              printed in dB and compatible with the volume audio filter.

       Video  filters allow you to modify the video stream and its properties.
       The syntax is:

       --vvff <<ffiilltteerr11[[==ppaarraammeetteerr11::ppaarraammeetteerr22::......]],,ffiilltteerr22,,......>>
              Setup a chain of video filters.

       Many parameters are optional and set to default values if omitted.   To
       explicitly use a default value set a parameter to '-1'.  Parameters w:h
       means width x height in pixels, x:y means x;y position counted from the
       upper left corner of the bigger image.
       _N_O_T_E_: To get a full list of available video filters, see -vf help.

       Video filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage
       the filter list.

       --vvff--aadddd <<ffiilltteerr11[[,,ffiilltteerr22,,......]]>>
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       --vvff--pprree <<ffiilltteerr11[[,,ffiilltteerr22,,......]]>>
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       --vvff--ddeell <<iinnddeexx11[[,,iinnddeexx22,,......]]>>
              Deletes the filters at the given indexes.  Index  numbers  start
              at  0,  negative  numbers address the end of the list (-1 is the
              last).

       --vvff--ccllrr
              Completely empties the filter list.

       With filters that support it, you can access parameters by their  name.

       --vvff <<ffiilltteerr>>==hheellpp
              Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for a par-
              ticular filter.

       --vvff <<ffiilltteerr==nnaammeedd__ppaarraammeetteerr11==vvaalluuee11[[::nnaammeedd__ppaarraammeetteerr22==vvaalluuee22::......]]>>
              Sets a named parameter to the given value.  Use on  and  off  or
              yes and no to set flag parameters.

       Available filters are:

       ccrroopp[[==ww::hh::xx::yy]]
              Crops the given part of the image and discards the rest.  Useful
              to remove black bands from widescreen movies.
                 <w>,<h>
                      Cropped width and height, defaults to original width and
                      height.
                 <x>,<y>
                      Position of the cropped picture, defaults to center.

       ccrrooppddeetteecctt[[==lliimmiitt::rroouunndd]]
              Calculates  necessary  cropping parameters and prints the recom-
              mended parameters to stdout.
                 <limit>
                      Threshold, which can be optionally specified from  noth-
                      ing (0) to everything (255) (default: 24).
                 <round>
                      Value which the width/height should be divisible by (de-
                      fault: 16).  The offset  is  automatically  adjusted  to
                      center  the  video.   Use  2 to get only even dimensions
                      (needed for 4:2:2 video).  16 is best when  encoding  to
                      most video codecs.

       rreeccttaannggllee[[==ww::hh::xx::yy]]
              Draws a rectangle of the requested width and height at the spec-
              ified coordinates over the image and  prints  current  rectangle
              parameters  to  the  console.   This can be used to find optimal
              cropping parameters.   If  you  bind  the  input.conf  directive
              'change_rectangle'  to  keystrokes,  you can move and resize the
              rectangle on the fly.
                 <w>,<h>
                      width and height (default: -1,  maximum  possible  width
                      where boundaries are still visible.)
                 <x>,<y>
                      top  left  corner position (default: -1, uppermost left-
                      most)

       eexxppaanndd[[==ww::hh::xx::yy::oo::aa::rr]]
              Expands (not scales) movie resolution to  the  given  value  and
              places  the  unscaled original at coordinates x, y.  Can be used
              for placing subtitles/OSD in the resulting black bands.

                 <w>,<h>
                      Expanded width,height (default: original  width,height).
                      Negative  values  for  w and h are treated as offsets to
                      the original size.

                      _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_:
                           expand=0:-50:0:0
                                  Adds a 50 pixel border to the bottom of  the
                                  picture.

                 <x>,<y>
                      position  of  original  image on the expanded image (de-

                 <a>
                      Expands to fit an aspect instead of  a  resolution  (de-
                      fault: 0).

                      _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_:
                           expand=800:::::4/3
                                  Expands  to  800x600,  unless  the source is
                                  higher resolution, in which case it  expands
                                  to fill a 4/3 aspect.

                 <r>
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by <r>
                      (default: 1).

       fflliipp ((aallssoo sseeee --fflliipp))
              Flips the image upside down.

       rroottaattee[[==<<00--77>>]]
              Rotates the image by 90 degrees and optionally  flips  it.   For
              values  between  4-7 rotation is only done if the movie geometry
              is portrait and not landscape.

                 0    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip (default).

                 1    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

              Changes  the  intended display size/aspect at an arbitrary point
              in the filter chain.  Aspect can be given as a fraction (4/3) or
              floating  point  number  (1.33).  Alternatively, you may specify
              the exact display width and height desired.  Note that this fil-
              ter  does  nnoott do any scaling itself; it just affects what later
              scalers (software or hardware) will do when auto-scaling to cor-
              rect aspect.

                 <w>,<h>
                      New display width and height.  Can also be these special

              filters must be separated by '/' and can be disabled by prepend-

              long  name  that can be used interchangeably, i.e. dr/dering are
              the same.  All subfilters  share  common  options  to  determine
              their scope:
                 a/autoq
                      Automatically switch the subfilter off if the CPU is too
                      slow.
                 c/chrom
                      Do chrominance filtering, too (default).
                 y/nochrom
                      Do luminance filtering only (no chrominance).
                 n/noluma
                      Do chrominance filtering only (no luminance).

              _N_O_T_E_: -pphelp shows a list of available subfilters.

              Available subfilters are

                 hb/hdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      horizontal deblocking filter
                         <difference>: Difference factor where  higher  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>:  Flatness  threshold  where  lower values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 vb/vdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      vertical deblocking filter
                         <difference>: Difference factor where  higher  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>:  Flatness  threshold  where  lower values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 ha/hadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      accurate horizontal deblocking filter
                         <difference>: Difference factor where  higher  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>:  Flatness  threshold  where  lower values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 va/vadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      accurate vertical deblocking filter
                         <difference>: Difference factor where  higher  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>:  Flatness  threshold  where  lower values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 The horizontal and vertical deblocking filters share the dif-
                 ference and flatness values so you cannot set different hori-
                 zontal and vertical thresholds.

              Simple  postprocessing  filter  that compresses and decompresses
              the image at several (or - in the case of quality level 6 - all)
              shifts and averages the results.

              decompresses  the  image at several (or - in the case of quality
              level 8 - all) shifts and averages the results.   The  way  this
              differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
              decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a  sim-
              plified intra only 8x8 DCT similar to MJPEG.

                      Filter strength, lower values mean more details but also
                      more artifacts,  while  higher  values  make  the  image
                      smoother  but also blurrier (default: 0 - PSNR optimal).

              Convert  planar  YUV 4:2:0 to half-height packed 4:2:2, downsam-
              pling luma but keeping all chroma samples.  Useful for output to
              low-resolution display devices when hardware downscaling is poor
              quality or is not available.  Can also be used  as  a  primitive
              luma-only deinterlacer with very low CPU usage.
                 <f>
                      By  default, halfpack averages pairs of lines when down-
                      sampling.  Any value different from 0 or 1 gives the de-
                      fault (averaging) behavior.
                         0: Only use even lines when downsampling.
                         1: Only use odd lines when downsampling.

              When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats, chroma in-
              terlacing does not line up properly due to vertical downsampling
              of the chroma channels.  This filter packs the planar 4:2:0 data
              into YUY2 (4:2:2) format with the chroma lines in  their  proper
              locations,  so  that  in any given scanline, the luma and chroma
              data both come from the same field.

       hhaarrdddduupp
              Only useful with MEncoder.  If harddup is used when encoding, it
              will  force  duplicate frames to be encoded in the output.  This
              uses slightly more space, but is necessary for  output  to  MPEG
              files  or  if you plan to demux and remux the video stream after
              encoding.  Should be placed at or near the  end  of  the  filter
              chain unless you have a good reason to do otherwise.

       ssooffttsskkiipp
              Only  useful  with  MEncoder.  Softskip moves the frame skipping
              (dropping) step of encoding from before the filter chain to some
              point  during  the filter chain.  This allows filters which need
              to see all frames (inverse telecine, temporal  denoising,  etc.)
              to  function properly.  Should be placed after the filters which
              need to see all frames and before any  subsequent  filters  that
              are CPU-intensive.

              Drops  frames that do not differ greatly from the previous frame
              in order to reduce framerate.  The main use of  this  filter  is
              for  very-low-bitrate  encoding  (e.g. streaming over dialup mo-
              dem), but it could in theory be used for fixing movies that were
              inverse-telecined incorrectly.
                 <max>
                      Sets  the maximum number of consecutive frames which can
                      be dropped (if positive), or the  minimum  interval  be-
                      tween dropped frames (if negative).
                 <hi>,<lo>,<frac>
                      A  frame  is  a  candidate for dropping if no 8x8 region
                      differs by more than a threshold of  <hi>,  and  if  not
                      more  than  <frac>  portion  (1 meaning the whole image)
                      differs by more than a threshold  of  <lo>.   Values  of
                      <hi> and <lo> are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent ac-
                      tual pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64  cor-
                      responds  to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the
                      same spread out differently over the block.

              (De)interleaves  lines.   The  goal of this filter is to add the
              ability to process interlaced images pre-field without  deinter-
              lacing  them.  You can filter your interlaced DVD and play it on
              a TV without  breaking  the  interlacing.   While  deinterlacing
              (with the postprocessing filter) removes interlacing permanently
              (by smoothing, averaging, etc) deinterleaving splits  the  frame
              into  2  fields  (so  called  half pictures), so you can process
              (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.

              filter  but  much  faster, the main disadvantage is that it does
              not always work.  Especially if combined with other  filters  it
              may  produce  randomly messed up images, so be happy if it works
              but do not complain if it does not for your combination of  fil-
              ters.

              Extracts a single field from an interlaced  image  using  stride
              arithmetic  to  avoid wasting CPU time.  The optional argument n

              ing on whether n is even or odd).

              Attempts  to  reverse the 'telecine' process to recover a clean,
              non-interlaced stream at film framerate.  This was the first and
              most  primitive  inverse telecine filter to be added to MPlayer/
              MEncoder.  It works by latching onto the  telecine  3:2  pattern
              and  following  it  as long as possible.  This makes it suitable
              for perfectly-telecined material, even in the presence of a fair
              degree  of  noise,  but  it will fail in the presence of complex
              post-telecine edits.  Development on this filter  is  no  longer
              taking  place, as ivtc, pullup, and filmdint are better for most
              applications.  The following arguments (see syntax above) may be
              used to control detc's behavior:

                 <dr>
                      Set the frame dropping mode.
                         0:  Do not drop frames to maintain fixed output fram-
                         erate (default).
                         1: Always drop a frame when there have been no  drops
                         or telecine merges in the past 5 frames.
                         2:  Always  maintain  exact 5:4 input to output frame
                         ratio.
                         _N_O_T_E_: Use mode 1 or 2 with MEncoder.

                         0: Fixed pattern with initial frame number  specified
                         by <fr>.
                         1: aggressive search for telecine pattern (default)

                 <fr>
                      Set initial frame number in sequence.  0-2 are the three
                      clean progressive frames; 3 and 4 are the two interlaced
                      frames.   The  default,  -1,  means 'not in telecine se-
                      quence'.  The number specified here is the type for  the
                      imaginary previous frame before the movie starts.

                 <t0>, <t1>, <t2>, <t3>
                      Threshold values to be used in certain modes.

       iivvttcc[[==11]]
              Experimental  'stateless'  inverse telecine filter.  Rather than
              trying to lock on to a pattern like the detc filter  does,  ivtc
              makes  its  decisions  independently  for each frame.  This will
              give much better results for material that has  undergone  heavy
              editing after telecine was applied, but as a result it is not as
              forgiving of noisy input, for example TV capture.  The  optional
              parameter  (ivtc=1)  corresponds to the dr=1 option for the detc
              filter, and should be used with MEncoder but not  with  MPlayer.
              As  with  detc,  you  must  specify the correct output framerate
              (-ofps 24000/1001) when using MEncoder.  Further development  on
              ivtc  has  stopped, as the pullup and filmdint filters appear to
              be much more accurate.

              Third-generation pulldown reversal  (inverse  telecine)  filter,
              capable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progres-
              sive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.  The pullup filter
              is  designed to be much more robust than detc or ivtc, by taking
              advantage of future context in making its decisions.  Like ivtc,
              pullup  is  stateless  in the sense that it does not lock onto a
              pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
              fields  in  order  to  identify  matches and rebuild progressive
              frames.  It is still under development, but believed to be quite
              accurate.

                 jl, jr, jt, and jb
                      These  options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the
                      left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively.
                      Left/right  are  in  units of 8 pixels, while top/bottom
                      are in units of 2 lines.  The default  is  8  pixels  on
                      each side.

                 sb (strict breaks)
                      Setting  this  option  to  1  will reduce the chances of
                      pullup generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it
                      may  also  cause  an  excessive  number  of frames to be
                      dropped during high motion sequences.  Conversely,  set-
                      ting it to -1 will make pullup match fields more easily.
                      This may help processing of video where there is  slight
                      blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to
                      be interlaced frames in the output.

                 mp (metric plane)
                      This option may be set to 1 or 2 to use a  chroma  plane
                      instead  of  the  luma plane for doing pullup's computa-
                      tions.  This may improve accuracy on very  clean  source
                      material,  but more likely will decrease accuracy, espe-
                      cially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or  any
                      grayscale  video.   The  main purpose of setting mp to a
                      chroma plane is to reduce CPU load and make  pullup  us-
                      able in realtime on slow machines.

              _N_O_T_E_:  Always follow pullup with the softskip filter when encod-
              ing to ensure that pullup is able to see each frame.  Failure to
              do  so will lead to incorrect output and will usually crash, due
              to design limitations in the codec/filter layer.

       ffiillmmddiinntt[[==ooppttiioonnss]]
              Inverse telecine filter, similar to the pullup filter above.  It
              is designed to handle any pulldown pattern, including mixed soft
              and hard telecine and limited support for movies that are slowed
              down  or sped up from their original framerate for TV.  Only the
              luma plane is used to find the frame breaks.  If a field has  no
              match,  it is deinterlaced with simple linear approximation.  If
              the source is MPEG-2, this must be the first filter to allow ac-
              cess to the field-flags set by the MPEG-2 decoder.  Depending on
              the source MPEG, you may be fine ignoring this advice,  as  long
              as  you  do not see lots of "Bottom-first field" warnings.  With
              no options it does normal inverse telecine, and should  be  used
              together  with  mencoder -fps 30000/1001 -ofps 24000/1001.  When
              this filter is used with MPlayer, it will result  in  an  uneven
              framerate during playback, but it is still generally better than
              using pp=lb or no deinterlacing at all.  Multiple options can be
              specified separated by /.

                 crop=<w>:<h>:<x>:<y>
                      Just  like  the  crop  filter,  but faster, and works on
                      mixed hard and soft telecined content as well as when  y
                      is  not  a multiple of 4.  If x or y would require crop-
                      ping fractional pixels from the chroma planes, the  crop
                      area  is extended.  This usually means that x and y must
                      be even.

                 io=<ifps>:<ofps>
                      For each ifps input frames the filter will  output  ofps
                      frames.    The  ratio  of  ifps/ofps  should  match  the
                      -fps/-ofps ratio.  This could be used to  filter  movies
                      that  are broadcast on TV at a frame rate different from
                      their original framerate.

                 luma_only=<n>
                      If n is nonzero, the chroma plane is  copied  unchanged.
                      This  is  useful for YV12 sampled TV, which discards one
                      of the chroma fields.

                 mmx2=<n>
                      On x86, if n=1, use MMX2 optimized  functions,  if  n=2,
                      use 3DNow!  optimized functions, otherwise, use plain C.
                      If this option is not specified, MMX2 and 3DNow! are au-
                      to-detected, use this option to override auto-detection.

                 fast=<n>
                      The larger n will speed up the filter at the expense  of
                      accuracy.   The  default  value  is n=3.  If n is odd, a
                      frame immediately following a frame marked with the  RE-
                      PEAT_FIRST_FIELD MPEG flag is assumed to be progressive,
                      thus filter will not spend any  time  on  soft-telecined
                      MPEG-2 content.  This is the only effect of this flag if
                      MMX2 or 3DNow! is available.  Without MMX2 and 3DNow, if
                      n=0 or 1, the same calculations will be used as with n=2
                      or 3.  If n=2 or 3, the number of luma  levels  used  to
                      find  the frame breaks is reduced from 256 to 128, which
                      results in a faster filter without losing much accuracy.
                      If  n=4  or  5,  a faster, but much less accurate metric
                      will be used to find the frame  breaks,  which  is  more
                      likely  to  misdetect high vertical detail as interlaced
                      content.

                 verbose=<n>
                      If n is nonzero, print the  detailed  metrics  for  each
                      frame.  Useful for debugging.

                 dint_thres=<n>
                      Deinterlace  threshold.   Used  during de-interlacing of
                      unmatched frames.  Larger value means  less  deinterlac-
                      ing,  use  n=256  to  completely turn off deinterlacing.
                      Default is n=8.

                 comb_thres=<n>
                      Threshold for comparing a top and  bottom  fields.   De-
                      faults to 128.

                 diff_thres=<n>
                      Threshold to detect temporal change of a field.  Default
                      is 128.

                 sad_thres=<n>
                      Sum of Absolute Difference threshold, default is 64.

              This filter works only correct with MEncoder  and  acts  on  the
              MPEG-2 flags used for soft 3:2 pulldown (soft telecine).  If you
              want to use the ivtc or detc filter on movies  that  are  partly
              soft  telecined,  inserting  this filter before them should make
              them more reliable.

       ddiivvttcc[[==ooppttiioonnss]]
              Inverse  telecine  for  deinterlaced  video.   If   3:2-pulldown
              telecined  video  has  lost one of the fields or is deinterlaced
              using a method that keeps one field and interpolates the  other,
              the  result is a juddering video that has every fourth frame du-
              plicated.  This filter is intended to find and drop those dupli-
              cates  and restore the original film framerate.  When using this
              filter, you must specify -ofps that is 4/5 of the fps of the in-
              put  file  and  place  the softskip later in the filter chain to
              make sure that divtc sees all the frames.  Two  different  modes
              are  available: One pass mode is the default and is straightfor-
              ward to use, but has the disadvantage that any  changes  in  the
              telecine phase (lost frames or bad edits) cause momentary judder
              until the filter can resync again.  Two pass mode avoids this by
              analyzing  the  whole  video  beforehand so it will have forward
              knowledge about the phase changes and can resync  at  the  exact
              spot.  These passes do nnoott correspond to pass one and two of the
              encoding process.  You must run an extra pass using  divtc  pass
              one  before  the  actual  encoding  throwing the resulting video
              away.  Use -nosound -ovc raw -o /dev/null to avoid  wasting  CPU
              power  for  this  pass.  You may add something like crop=2:2:0:0
              after divtc to speed things up even more.  Then use  divtc  pass
              two  for the actual encoding.  If you use multiple encoder pass-
              es, use divtc pass two for all of them.  The options are:

                 pass=1|2
                      Use two pass mode.

                 file=<filename>
                      Set  the  two  pass  log  filename  (default:   "framed-
                      iff.log").

                 threshold=<value>
                      Set  the minimum strength the telecine pattern must have
                      for the filter to believe in it (default: 0.5).  This is
                      used  to  avoid recognizing false pattern from the parts
                      of the video that are very dark or very still.

                 window=<numframes>
                      Set the number of past frames to look at when  searching
                      for  pattern  (default: 30).  Longer window improves the
                      reliability of the pattern search,  but  shorter  window
                      improves  the  reaction  time  to  the  changes  in  the
                      telecine phase.  This only affects the  one  pass  mode.
                      The  two  pass mode currently uses fixed window that ex-
                      tends to both future and past.

                 phase=0|1|2|3|4
                      Sets the initial telecine phase for one pass  mode  (de-
                      fault:  0).  The two pass mode can see the future, so it
                      is able to use the correct phase from the beginning, but
                      one  pass  mode  can only guess.  It catches the correct
                      phase when it finds it, but this option can be  used  to
                      fix  the possible juddering at the beginning.  The first
                      pass of the two pass mode also uses this, so if you save
                      the  output  from the first pass, you get constant phase
                      result.

                 deghost=<value>
                      Set the deghosting threshold (0-255 for one  pass  mode,
                      -255-255  for  two  pass  mode, default 0).  If nonzero,
                      deghosting mode is used.  This is  for  video  that  has
                      been  deinterlaced  by  blending the fields together in-
                      stead of dropping one of the fields.  Deghosting  ampli-
                      fies any compression artifacts in the blended frames, so
                      the parameter value is used as a  threshold  to  exclude
                      those pixels from deghosting that differ from the previ-
                      ous frame less than specified value.  If two  pass  mode
                      is  used,  then  negative  value can be used to make the
                      filter analyze the  whole  video  in  the  beginning  of
                      pass-2  to  determine whether it needs deghosting or not
                      and then select either zero or the absolute value of the
                      parameter.   Specify this option for pass-2, it makes no
                      difference on pass-1.

              Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the field order
              changes.   The  intended use is to fix PAL movies that have been
              captured with the opposite  field  order  to  the  film-to-video
              transfer.  The options are:

                 t    Capture  field  order  top-first, transfer bottom-first.
                      Filter will delay the bottom field.

                 b    Capture bottom-first, transfer top-first.   Filter  will
                      delay the top field.

                 p    Capture  and  transfer  with the same field order.  This
                      mode only exists for the documentation of the other  op-
                      tions  to  refer  to, but if you actually select it, the
                      filter will faithfully do nothing ;-)

                 a    Capture field order determined  automatically  by  field
                      flags,  transfer opposite.  Filter selects among t and b
                      modes on a frame by frame basis using field  flags.   If
                      no  field information is available, then this works just
                      like u.

                 u    Capture unknown or varying, transfer  opposite.   Filter
                      selects  among t and b on a frame by frame basis by ana-
                      lyzing the images and  selecting  the  alternative  that
                      produces best match between the fields.

                 T    Capture  top-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter
                      selects among t and p using image analysis.

                 B    Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Fil-
                      ter selects among b and p using image analysis.

                 A    Capture  determined  by field flags, transfer unknown or
                      varying.  Filter selects among t, b and  p  using  field
                      flags  and  image  analysis.  If no field information is
                      available, then this works just like U.  This is the de-
                      fault mode.

                 U    Both  capture  and  transfer unknown or varying.  Filter
                      selects among t, b and p using image analysis only.

                 v    Verbose operation.  Prints the selected  mode  for  each
                      frame  and the average squared difference between fields
                      for t, b, and p alternatives.

              Apply 3:2 'telecine' process to increase framerate by 20%.  This
              most  likely will not work correctly with MPlayer, but it can be

              break if they are wrong.)  The optional  start  parameter  tells

              Temporal  field  interlacing - merge pairs of frames into an in-
              terlaced frame, halving the framerate.  Even  frames  are  moved
              into  the  upper field, odd frames to the lower field.  This can
              be used to fully reverse the effect of the  tfields  filter  (in
              mode 0).  Available modes are:
                 0    Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the low-
                      er field, generating a full-height frame at half framer-
                      ate.
                 1    Only  output odd frames, even frames are dropped; height
                      unchanged.
                 2    Only output even frames, odd frames are dropped;  height
                      unchanged.
                 3    Expand  each  frame  to  full  height, but pad alternate
                      lines with black; framerate unchanged.
                 4    Interleave even lines from even frames  with  odd  lines
                      from odd frames.  Height unchanged at half framerate.

              Temporal  field  separation - split fields into frames, doubling
              the output framerate.  Like the telecine  filter,  tfields  will
              only work properly with MEncoder, and only if both -fps and -of-
              ps are set to the desired (double) framerate!

              The bitmap overlay filter reads bitmaps from a FIFO and displays
              them  on  top of the movie, allowing some transformations on the
              image.  Also see TOOLS/bmovl-test.c for a small bmovl test  pro-
              gram.
                 <hidden>
                      Set  the  default value of the 'hidden' flag (0=visible,
                      1=hidden).
                 <opaque>
                      Set the default value of the 'opaque' flag  (0=transpar-
                      ent, 1=opaque).
                 <fifo>
                      path/filename   for  the  FIFO  (named  pipe  connecting
                      'mplayer -vf bmovl' to the controlling application)

              FIFO commands are:
                 RGBA32 width height xpos ypos alpha clear
                      followed by width*height*4 Bytes of raw RGBA32 data.
                 ABGR32 width height xpos ypos alpha clear
                      followed by width*height*4 Bytes of raw ABGR32 data.
                 RGB24 width height xpos ypos alpha clear

                      Clear area.
                 OPAQUE
                      Disable all alpha transparency.  Send "ALPHA 0 0 0 0  0"
                      to enable it again.
                 HIDE
                      Hide bitmap.
                 SHOW
                      Show bitmap.

              Arguments are:
                 <width>, <height>
                      image/area size
                 <xpos>, <ypos>
                      Start blitting at position x/y.
                 <alpha>
                      Set  alpha  difference.  If you set this to -255 you can
                      then send a sequence of ALPHA-commands to set  the  area
                      to -225, -200, -175 etc for a nice fade-in-effect! ;)
                         0:    same as original
                         255:  Make everything opaque.
                         -255: Make everything transparent.

                 <clear>
                      Clear the framebuffer before blitting.
                         0:  The  image will just be blitted on top of the old
                         one, so you do not need to send 1.8MB of RGBA32  data
                         every time a small part of the screen is updated.
                         1: clear

       ffrraammeesstteepp==II||[[ii]]sstteepp
              Renders only every nth frame or every intra frame (keyframe).

              If you call the filter with I (uppercase) as the parameter, then
              oonnllyy keyframes are rendered.  For DVDs it generally means one in
              every  15/12  frames  (IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB),  for AVI it means every
              scene change or every keyint value (see -lavcopts keyint=  value
              if you use MEncoder to encode the video).

              When  a  keyframe is found, an 'I!' string followed by a newline
              character is printed, leaving the current line  of  MPlayer/MEn-
              coder  output  on  the  screen, because it contains the time (in
              seconds) and frame number of the keyframe (You can use this  in-
              formation to split the AVI.).

              If you call the filter with a numeric parameter 'step' then only
              one in every 'step' frames is rendered.

              If you put an 'i' (lowercase) before the number then an 'I!'  is
              printed (like the I parameter).

              If  you give only the i then nothing is done to the frames, only
              I! is printed.

              Tile a series of images into a single,  bigger  image.   If  you
              omit  a  parameter  or use a value less than 0, then the default
              value is used.  You can also stop when you  are  satisfied  (...
              -vf tile=10:5 ...).  It is probably a good idea to put the scale
              filter before the tile :-)

              The parameters are:

                 <xtiles>
                      number of tiles on the x axis (default: 5)
                 <ytiles>
                      number of tiles on the y axis (default: 5)
                 <output>
                      Render the tile  when  'output'  number  of  frames  are
                      reached,  where  'output'  should  be a number less than
                      xtile * ytile.   Missing  tiles  are  left  blank.   You
                      could,  for example, write an 8 * 7 tile every 50 frames
                      to have one image every 2 seconds @ 25 fps.
                 <start>
                      outer border thickness in pixels (default: 2)
                 <delta>
                      inner border thickness in pixels (default: 4)

                      ters.

              Suppresses a TV station logo, using a PGM or PPM image  file  to
              determine  which pixels comprise the logo.  The width and height
              of the image file must match those of  the  video  stream  being
              processed.   Uses the filter image and a circular blur algorithm

                      hardware can upscale the resulting MJPEG images  to  the
                      original  size.   The  option fd instructs the filter to
                      always perform the requested decimation (ugly).

              Files named 'shotNNNN.png' will be saved in the working directo-
              ry, using the first available number - no files  will  be  over-
              written.   The  filter has no overhead when not used and accepts
              an arbitrary colorspace, so it is safe to add it to the configu-
              ration file.

              Delays  either  audio  or  video by setting a delay field in the
              header (default: 0.0).  This does not delay either stream  while
              encoding, but the player will see the delay field and compensate
              accordingly.  Positive values delay the audio, and negative val-
              ues  delay  the  video.  Note that this is the exact opposite of
              the -delay option.  For example, if a video plays correctly with
              -delay  0.2,  you  can fix the video with MEncoder by using -au-
              dio-delay -0.2.

              Currently, this option only works with the  default  muxer  (-of
              avi).   If  you  are  using a different muxer, then you must use
              -delay instead.

              In  CBR  mode this parameter indicates the bitrate in kbps, when
              in VBR mode it is the minimum bitrate allowed  per  frame.   VBR

              Use  only  bit  exact  algorithms (except (I)DCT).  Additionally
              bit_exact disables several optimizations and thus should only be
              used  for  regression  tests,  which need binary identical files
              even if the encoder version changes.  This also  suppresses  the
              user_data  header in MPEG-4 streams.  Do not use this option un-

              minimum quantizer

                 1    Not  recommended  (much larger file, little quality dif-
                      ference and weird side effects: msmpeg4,  h263  will  be
                      very low quality, ratecontrol will be confused resulting
                      in lower quality and some decoders will not be  able  to
                      decode it).

                 2    Recommended  for  normal  mpeg4/mpeg1video encoding (de-
                      fault).

                 3    Recommended for h263(p)/msmpeg4.  The reason for prefer-
                      ring  3 over 2 is that 2 could lead to overflows.  (This
                      will be fixed for h263(p) by changing the quantizer  per
                      MB in the future, msmpeg4 cannot be fixed as it does not
                      support that.)

       llmmiinn==<<00..0011--225555..00>>
              Minimum frame-level Lagrange  multiplier  for  ratecontrol  (de-
              fault: 2.0).  Lavc will rarely use quantizers below the value of
              lmin.  Lowering lmin will make lavc more likely to choose  lower
              quantizers  for  some  frames,  but  not lower than the value of
              vqmin.  Likewise, raising lmin will make  lavc  less  likely  to
              choose  low  quantizers,  even if vqmin would have allowed them.
              You probably want to set  lmin  approximately  equal  to  vqmin.
              When  adaptive  quantization  is  in use, changing lmin/lmax may
              have less of an effect; see mblmin/mblmax.

              less encoding.  Since the other codecs do not support this, vqs-
              cale=0 will have an undefined effect.  1 is not recommended (see

              Macroblock decision algorithm (high quality mode),  encode  each
              macro  block in all modes and choose the best.  This is slow but
              results in better quality and file size.  When mbd is set  to  1
              or  2,  the value of mbcmp is ignored when comparing macroblocks
              (the mbcmp value is still used in other places though,  in  par-
              ticular  the  motion search algorithms).  If any comparison set-
              ting (precmp, subcmp, cmp, or  mbcmp)  is  nonzero,  however,  a
              slower  but  better half-pel motion search will be used, regard-
              less of what mbd is set to.  If qpel is set, quarter-pel  motion
              search will be used regardless.
                 0    Use comparison function given by mbcmp (default).
                 1    Select the MB mode which needs the fewest bits (=vhq).

              maximum interval between keyframes in frames  (default:  250  or
              one  keyframe  every  ten seconds in a 25fps movie.  This is the
              recommended default for MPEG-4).  Most  codecs  require  regular
              keyframes  in order to limit the accumulation of mismatch error.
              Keyframes are also needed for seeking, as seeking is only possi-
              ble  to  a  keyframe  - but keyframes need more space than other
              frames, so larger numbers here mean slightly smaller  files  but
              less  precise  seeking.  0 is equivalent to 1, which makes every
              frame a keyframe.  Values >300 are not recommended as the quali-
              ty might be bad depending upon decoder, encoder and luck.  It is
              common for MPEG-1/2 to use values <=30.

              Threshold for scene change detection.  A keyframe is inserted by
              libavcodec  when it detects a scene change.  You can specify the
              sensitivity of the  detection  with  this  option.   -1000000000
              means   there  is  a  scene  change  detected  at  every  frame,
              1000000000 means no scene changes are detected (default: 0).

              Causes frames with higher quantizers to be more likely to  trig-
              ger  a scene change detection and make libavcodec use an I-frame
              (default: 1).  1-16 is a sane range.  Values between 2 and 6 may
              yield  increasing  PSNR (up to approximately 0.04 dB) and better
              placement of I-frames in high-motion scenes.  Higher values than
              6 may give very slightly better PSNR (approximately 0.01 dB more
              than sc_factor=6), but noticably worse visual quality.

              strategy to choose between I/P/B-frames:
                 0    Always use the maximum number of B-frames (default).
                 1    Avoid B-frames in high motion scenes.  See the  b_sensi-
                      tivity option to tune this strategy.
                 2    Places  B-frames more or less optimally to yield maximum
                      quality (slower).  You may want to reduce the speed  im-
                      pact of this option by tuning the option brd_scale.

              Adjusts  how sensitively vb_strategy=1 detects motion and avoids
              using B-frames (default: 40).  Lower sensitivities  will  result
              in  more  B-frames.   Using more B-frames usually improves PSNR,
              but too many B-frames can hurt quality  in  high-motion  scenes.
              Unless there is an extremely high amount of motion, b_sensitivi-
              ty can safely be lowered below the default; 10 is  a  reasonable
              value in most cases.

       bbrrdd__ssccaallee==<<00--1100>>
              Downscales  frames  for  dynamic  B-frame decision (default: 0).
              Each time brd_scale is increased by one,  the  frame  dimensions
              are  divided  by  two, which improves speed by a factor of four.
              Both dimensions of the fully downscaled frame must be even  num-
              bers, so brd_scale=1 requires the original dimensions to be mul-
              tiples of four, brd_scale=2 requires multiples  of  eight,  etc.
              In  other  words, the dimensions of the original frame must both
              be divisible by 2^(brd_scale+1) with no remainder.

       vvppaassss==<<11--33>>
              Activates internal two (or more) pass mode, only specify if  you
              wish to use two (or more) pass encoding.
                 1    first pass (also see turbo)
                 2    second pass
                 3    Nth  pass (second and subsequent passes of N-pass encod-
                      ing)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The first pass (vpass=1) writes the statistics file.  You  might
              want  to  deactivate  some CPU-hungry options, like "turbo" mode
              does.
              In two pass mode, the second pass (vpass=2) reads the statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In  N-pass  mode,  the second pass (vpass=3, that is not a typo)
              does both: It first reads the statistics, then overwrites  them.
              You  might  want  to  backup  divx2pass.log before doing this if
              there is any possibility that you will have to cancel  MEncoder.
              You can use all encoding options, except very CPU-hungry options
              like "qns".
              You can run this same pass over and over to refine  the  encode.
              Each  subsequent  pass will use the statistics from the previous
              pass to improve.  The final pass can include any CPU-hungry  en-
              coding options.
              If  you  want  a  2  pass  encode,  use  first vpass=1, and then
              vpass=2.
              If you want a 3 or more pass encode, use vpass=1 for  the  first
              pass and then vpass=3 and then vpass=3 again and again until you
              are satisfied with the encode.

              huffyuv:
                 pass 1
                      Saves statistics.
                 pass 2
                      Encodes with an optimal Huffman table based upon statis-
                      tics from the first pass.

              Dramatically speeds up pass one using faster algorithms and dis-
              abling CPU-intensive options.  This will probably reduce  global
              PSNR  a  little  bit (around 0.01dB) and change individual frame
              type and PSNR a little bit more (up to 0.03dB).

              Store movie aspect internally, just like with MPEG files.   Much
              nicer  than  rescaling,  because quality is not decreased.  Only
              MPlayer will play these files correctly, other players will dis-
              play  them with wrong aspect.  The aspect parameter can be given

              so you can safely leave it always on.

              ror-resistance when transferring over unreliable channels  (e.g.
              streaming over the internet).  Each video packet will be encoded
              in 3 separate partitions:
                 1. MVs
                      movement
                 2. DC coefficients
                      low res picture
                 3. AC coefficients
                      details
              MV & DC are most important, losing them  looks  far  worse  than
              losing  the  AC  and  the  1. & 2. partition.  (MV & DC) are far
              smaller than the 3. partition (AC) meaning that errors will  hit
              the  AC  partition  much more often than the MV & DC partitions.
              Thus, the picture will look better with partitioning than  with-
              out, as without partitioning an error will trash AC/DC/MV equal-
              ly.

              Luminance masking is a 'psychosensory' setting that is  supposed
              to make use of the fact that the human eye tends to notice fewer
              details in very bright parts of the picture.  Luminance  masking
              compresses  bright  areas  stronger than medium ones, so it will
              save bits that can be spent again on other frames, raising over-

              Temporal complexity masking (default: 0.0 (disabled)).   Imagine
              a  scene  with  a bird flying across the whole scene; tcplx_mask
              will raise the quantizers of the bird's  macroblocks  (thus  de-
              creasing  their quality), as the human eye usually does not have
              time to see all the bird's  details.   Be  warned  that  if  the
              masked  object  stops (e.g. the bird lands) it is likely to look
              horrible for a short period of time, until the  encoder  figures
              out that the object is not moving and needs refined blocks.  The
              saved bits will be spent on other parts of the video, which  may
              increase  subjective  quality, provided that tcplx_mask is care-
              fully chosen.

              Spatial complexity masking.  Larger values help against  blocki-
              ness,  if  no  deblocking  filter is used for decoding, which is
              maybe not a good idea.
              Imagine a scene with grass (which usually has great spatial com-
              plexity),  a  blue  sky  and  a house; scplx_mask will raise the
              quantizers of the grass' macroblocks, thus decreasing its quali-
              ty, in order to spend more bits on the sky and the house.
              _H_I_N_T_:  Crop any black borders completely as they will reduce the

              Reduces the quality of inter blocks.  This is equivalent to  in-
              creasing  the  quality of intra blocks, because the same average
              bitrate will be distributed by the rate controller to the  whole
              video  sequence  (default:  0.0 (disabled)).  p_mask=1.0 doubles
              the bits allocated to each intra block.

              border-processing for MPEG-style  encoders.   Border  processing
              increases  the  quantizer  for  macroblocks  which are less than
              1/5th of the frame width/height  away  from  the  frame  border,
              since they are often visually less important.

              When surrounding motion vectors are <0,0> and the motion estima-
              tion  score  of  the  current  block is less than mv0_threshold,
              <0,0> is used for the motion vector and further  motion  estima-
              tion is skipped (default: 256).  Lowering mv0_threshold to 0 can
              give a slight (0.01dB) PSNR increase and possibly make  the  en-
              coded video look slightly better; raising mv0_threshold past 320
              results in diminished PSNR and visual  quality.   Higher  values
              speed up encoding very slightly (usually less than 1%, depending
              on the other options used).

              Quantizer  noise  shaping.  Rather than choosing quantization to

              This option controls the motion estimation subsystem.  The high-
              er  the  value,  the  more precise the estimation should be (de-
              fault: 6).  The more precise the motion estimation is, the  more
              bits  can  be  saved.  Precision is gained at the expense of CPU
              time so decrease this setting if you need realtime encoding.

       ((nnoo))qqppeell
              MPEG-4 uses a half pixel precision for its motion search by  de-
              fault.   The standard proposes a mode where encoders are allowed
              to use quarter pixel precision.  This option usually results  in
              a sharper image.  Unfortunately it has a great impact on bitrate
              and sometimes the higher bitrate use will prevent it from giving
              a better image quality at a fixed bitrate.  It is better to test
              with and without this option and see whether it is  worth  acti-
              vating.

              special frames (GMC-frames) which are well suited for  Pan/Zoom/

              save bits is highly dependent on the source material.

       ((nnoo))ttrreelllliiss
              Trellis Quantization is a kind of adaptive  quantization  method
              that saves bits by modifying quantized coefficients to make them
              more compressible by the entropy encoder.  Its impact on quality
              is  good, and if VHQ uses too much CPU for you, this setting can
              be a good alternative to save a few bits (and  gain  quality  at
              fixed bitrate) at a lesser cost than with VHQ (default: on).

       ((nnoo))ccaarrttoooonn
              Activate  this if your encoded sequence is an anime/cartoon.  It
              modifies some Xvid internal thresholds so Xvid takes better  de-
              cisions  on frame types and motion vectors for flat looking car-
              toons.

       ((nnoo))cchhrroommaa__mmee
              The usual motion estimation algorithm uses  only  the  luminance
              information  to  find  the best motion vector.  However for some
              video material, using the chroma planes  can  help  find  better
              vectors.   This setting toggles the use of chroma planes for mo-
              tion estimation (default: on).

              ic on color information to minimize the stepped-stairs effect on
              edges.  It will improve quality at the cost of  encoding  speed.
              It  reduces PSNR by nature, as the mathematical deviation to the
              original picture will get bigger, but the subjective image qual-
              ity  will  raise.   Since  it  works with color information, you
              might want to turn it off when encoding in grayscale.

              not only the spatial difference but also the encoding length  of

              picture.   It  compresses  those areas more strongly than medium
              ones, which will save bits that can  be  spent  again  on  other
              frames, raising overall subjective quality and possibly reducing
              PSNR.

              Make  Xvid  discard  chroma  planes  so  the  encoded  video  is
              grayscale  only.   Note that this does not speed up encoding, it
              just prevents chroma data from being written in the  last  stage
              of encoding.

              Shift  some  bits  from  the pool for other frame types to intra

              kfthreshold  sets  the range in which keyframes are reduced, and
              kfreduction determines the bitrate reduction they get.  The last

              This setting allows you to specify what priority to place on the
              use of B-frames.  The higher the value, the higher the probabil-
              ity of B-frames being used (default: 0).  Do not forget that  B-
              frames usually have a higher quantizer, and therefore aggressive
              production of B-frames may cause worse visual quality.

       ((nnoo))cclloosseedd__ggoopp
              This option tells Xvid to close every  GOP  (Group  Of  Pictures
              bounded by two I-frames), which makes GOPs independent from each
              other.  This just implies that the last frame of the GOP is  ei-
              ther  a P-frame or a N-frame but not a B-frame.  It is usually a
              good idea to turn this option on (default: on).

       ((nnoo))ppaacckkeedd
              This option is meant to solve frame-order issues  when  encoding
              to container formats like AVI that cannot cope with out-of-order
              frames.  In practice, most decoders (both software and hardware)
              are  able  to deal with frame-order themselves, and may get con-
              fused when this option is turned on, so you can safely leave  if
              off, unless you really know what you are doing.

              This setting allows the creation  of  variable  framerate  video
              streams.   The  value of the setting specifies a threshold under
              which, if the difference of the following frame to the  previous
              frame is below or equal to this threshold, a frame gets not cod-
              ed (a so called n-vop is placed in the  stream).   On  playback,
              when reaching an n-vop the previous frame will be displayed.
              _W_A_R_N_I_N_G_:  Playing with this setting may result in a jerky video,

              This parameter controls the number of frames the CBR  rate  con-
              troller will wait before reacting to bitrate changes and compen-
              sating for them to obtain a constant bitrate over  an  averaging
              range of frames.

              Real  CBR  is hard to achieve.  Depending on the video material,
              bitrate can be variable, and hard to  predict.   Therefore  Xvid
              uses  an averaging period for which it guarantees a given amount
              of bits (minus a small variation).  This settings expresses  the
              "number  of frames" for which Xvid averages bitrate and tries to
              achieve CBR.

              This setting allows Xvid to take a certain  percentage  of  bits
              away  from  high  bitrate  scenes  and give them back to the bit
              reservoir.  You could also use this if you have a clip  with  so
              many  bits allocated to high-bitrate scenes that the low(er)-bi-
              trate scenes start to look bad (default: 0).

              This setting allows Xvid to give a certain percentage  of  extra
              bits  to  the low bitrate scenes, taking a few bits from the en-
              tire clip.  This might come in handy if you have a  few  low-bi-
              trate scenes that are still blocky (default: 0).

              During  pass one of two pass encoding, a scaled bitrate curve is
              computed.  The difference between that expected  curve  and  the
              result  obtained during encoding is called overflow.  Obviously,
              the two pass rate controller tries to compensate for that  over-
              flow,  distributing  it over the next frames.  This setting con-
              trols how much of the overflow is distributed every  time  there
              is  a  new  frame.   Low values allow lazy overflow control, big
              rate bursts are compensated for more slowly (could lead to  lack
              of  precision for small clips).  Higher values will make changes
              in bit redistribution more abrupt, possibly too  abrupt  if  you
              set it too high, creating artifacts (default: 5).
              _N_O_T_E_:  This setting impacts quality a lot, play with it careful-

              During the frame bit allocation, overflow control  may  increase
              the frame size.  This parameter specifies the maximum percentage
              by which the overflow control is allowed to increase  the  frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

              During  the  frame bit allocation, overflow control may decrease
              the frame size.  This parameter specifies the maximum percentage
              by  which  the overflow control is allowed to decrease the frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

              Specifies a frame average overhead per frame, in bytes.  Most of
              the time users express their target bitrate for video w/o taking
              care of the video container overhead.  This small  but  (mostly)
              constant overhead can cause the target file size to be exceeded.
              Xvid allows users to set the amount of overhead  per  frame  the
              container  generates  (give only an average per frame).  0 has a
              special meaning, it lets Xvid use its own  default  values  (de-
              fault: 24 - AVI average overhead).

              Specifies the Pixel Aspect Ratio mode (not to be  confused  with
              DAR,  the  Display Aspect Ratio).  PAR is the ratio of the width
              and height of a single pixel.  So both are  related  like  this:
              DAR = PAR * (width/height).
              MPEG-4  defines 5 pixel aspect ratios and one extended one, giv-

       ((nnoo))aauuttooaassppeecctt
              Same as the aspect option, but  automatically  computes  aspect,
              taking into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.)
              made in the filter chain.

       ppssnnrr
              Print the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for the whole  video
              after  encoding  and  store  the per frame PSNR in a file with a
              name like 'psnr_hhmmss.log' in the current directory.   Returned
              values are in dB (decibel), the higher the better.

       ddeebbuugg
              Save  per-frame  statistics  in ./xvid.dbg. (This is not the two
              pass control file.)


       The following option is only available in Xvid 1.1.x.

       bbvvhhqq==<<00||11>>
              This setting allows vector candidates for B-frames  to  be  used
              for the encoding chosen using a rate distortion optimized opera-
              tor, which is what is done for P-frames by the vhq option.  This
              produces  nicer-looking  B-frames while incurring almost no per-
              formance penalty (default: 1).


       The following option is only available in the 1.2.x version of Xvid.

       tthhrreeaaddss==<<00--nn>>
              Create n threads to run the motion estimation (default: 0).  The
              maximum number of threads that can be used is the picture height
              divided by 16.

   xx226644eenncc ((--xx226644eennccooppttss))
       bbiittrraattee==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Sets the average bitrate to be used  in  kbits/second  (default:
              off).  Since local bitrate may vary, this average may be inaccu-
              rate for very short videos (see ratetol).  Constant bitrate  can
              be  achieved  by combining this with vbv_maxrate, at significant
              reduction in quality.

       qqpp==<<00--5511>>
              This selects the quantizer to use for P-frames.  I- and B-frames
              are  offset  from this value by ip_factor and pb_factor, respec-
              tively.  20-40 is a useful range.  Lower values result in better
              fidelity,  but higher bitrates.  0 is lossless.  Note that quan-
              tization in H.264 works  differently  from  MPEG-1/2/4:  H.264's
              quantization parameter (QP) is on a logarithmic scale.  The map-
              ping is approximately H264QP = 12 + 6*log2(MPEGQP).   For  exam-
              ple, MPEG at QP=2 is equivalent to H.264 at QP=18.

       ccrrff==<<11..00--5500..00>>
              Enables  constant  quality  mode,  and selects the quality.  The
              scale is similar to QP.  Like the bitrate-based modes, this  al-
              lows  each frame to use a different QP based on the frame's com-
              plexity.

       ppaassss==<<11--33>>
              Enable 2 or 3-pass mode.  It is recommended to always encode  in
              2  or  3-pass  mode as it leads to a better bit distribution and
              improves overall quality.
                 1    first pass
                 2    second pass (of two pass encoding)
                 3    Nth pass (second and third passes of three  pass  encod-
                      ing)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The  first  pass  (pass=1)  collects statistics on the video and
              writes them to a file.  You might want to deactivate  some  CPU-
              hungry options, apart from the ones that are on by default.
              In  two pass mode, the second pass (pass=2) reads the statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In three pass mode, the second pass (pass=3, that is not a typo)
              does  both: It first reads the statistics, then overwrites them.
              You can use all encoding options,  except  very  CPU-hungry  op-
              tions.
              The  third  pass (pass=3) is the same as the second pass, except
              that it has the second pass' statistics to work from.   You  can
              use all encoding options, including CPU-hungry ones.
              The  first pass may use either average bitrate or constant quan-
              tizer.  ABR is recommended, since it does not require guessing a
              quantizer.  Subsequent passes are ABR, and must specify bitrate.

       ttuurrbboo==<<00--22>>
              Fast first pass mode.  During the first pass of a  two  or  more
              pass  encode  it is possible to gain speed by disabling some op-
              tions with negligible or even no impact on the final pass output
              quality.
                 0    disabled (default)
                 1    Reduce  subq, frameref and disable some inter-macroblock
                      partition analysis modes.
                 2    Reduce subq and frameref to 1, use a diamond  ME  search
                      and disable all partition analysis modes.
              Level 1 can increase first pass speed up to 2x with no change in
              the global PSNR of the final pass compared  to  a  full  quality
              first pass.
              Level  2  can  increase first pass speed up to 4x with about +/-
              0.05dB change in the global PSNR of the final pass compared to a
              full quality first pass.

       kkeeyyiinntt==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Sets maximum interval between IDR-frames (default: 250).  Larger
              values save bits, thus improve quality, at the cost  of  seeking
              precision.   Unlike  MPEG-1/2/4,  H.264 does not suffer from DCT
              drift with large values of keyint.

       kkeeyyiinntt__mmiinn==<<11--kkeeyyiinntt//22>>
              Sets minimum interval  between  IDR-frames  (default:  25).   If
              scenecuts appear within this interval, they are still encoded as
              I-frames, but do not start a new GOP.  In H.264, I-frames do not
              necessarily  bound a closed GOP because it is allowable for a P-
              frame to be predicted from more frames than just the  one  frame
              before it (also see frameref).  Therefore, I-frames are not nec-
              essarily seekable.  IDR-frames restrict subsequent P-frames from
              referring to any frame prior to the IDR-frame.

       sscceenneeccuutt==<<--11--110000>>
              Controls  how  aggressively  to  insert extra I-frames (default:
              40).  With small values of scenecut,  the  codec  often  has  to
              force  an  I-frame  when it would exceed keyint.  Good values of
              scenecut may find a better location for the I-frame.  Large val-
              ues  use  more  I-frames  than necessary, thus wasting bits.  -1
              disables scene-cut detection, so I-frames are inserted only once
              every  other  keyint frames, even if a scene-cut occurs earlier.
              This is not recommended and wastes bitrate as scenecuts  encoded
              as  P-frames  are  just as big as I-frames, but do not reset the
              "keyint counter".

       ffrraammeerreeff==<<11--1166>>
              Number of previous frames used as predictors in B- and  P-frames
              (default:  1).   This  is effective in anime, but in live-action
              material the improvements usually drop off very rapidly above  6
              or  so  reference frames.  This has no effect on decoding speed,
              but does increase the memory needed for decoding.  Some decoders
              can only handle a maximum of 15 reference frames.

       bbffrraammeess==<<00--1166>>
              maximum  number  of consecutive B-frames between I- and P-frames
              (default: 0)

       ((nnoo))bb__aaddaapptt
              Automatically decides when to use B-frames and how many,  up  to
              the  maximum  specified  above (default: on).  If this option is
              disabled, then the maximum number of B-frames is used.

       bb__bbiiaass==<<--110000--110000>>
              Controls the decision performed by  b_adapt.   A  higher  b_bias
              produces more B-frames (default: 0).

       ((nnoo))bb__ppyyrraammiidd
              Allows  B-frames  to  be used as references for predicting other
              frames.  For example, consider 3 consecutive B-frames: I0 B1  B2
              B3 P4.  Without this option, B-frames follow the same pattern as
              MPEG-[124].  So they are coded in the order I0 P4 B1 B2 B3,  and
              all  the  B-frames  are predicted from I0 and P4.  With this op-
              tion, they are coded as I0 P4 B2 B1  B3.   B2  is  the  same  as
              above,  but  B1 is predicted from I0 and B2, and B3 is predicted
              from B2 and P4.  This usually results in slightly improved  com-
              pression,  at almost no speed cost.  However, this is an experi-
              mental option: it is not fully tuned and may  not  always  help.
              Requires  bframes  >= 2.  Disadvantage: increases decoding delay
              to 2 frames.

       ((nnoo))ddeebblloocckk
              Use deblocking filter (default: on).  As it  takes  very  little
              time compared to its quality gain, it is not recommended to dis-
              able it.

       ddeebblloocckk==<<--66--66>>,,<<--66--66>>
              The first parameter  is  AlphaC0  (default:  0).   This  adjusts
              thresholds for the H.264 in-loop deblocking filter.  First, this
              parameter adjusts the maximum amount of change that  the  filter
              is  allowed to cause on any one pixel.  Secondly, this parameter
              affects the threshold for difference across the edge being  fil-
              tered.   A  positive  value reduces blocking artifacts more, but
              will also smear details.
              The second parameter is Beta (default: 0).  This affects the de-
              tail  threshold.   Very  detailed blocks are not filtered, since
              the smoothing caused by the filter would be more noticeable than
              the original blocking.
              The  default behavior of the filter almost always achieves opti-
              mal quality, so it is best to either leave it alone, or make on-
              ly  small adjustments.  However, if your source material already
              has some blocking or noise which you would like  to  remove,  it
              may be a good idea to turn it up a little bit.

       ((nnoo))ccaabbaacc
              Use  CABAC (Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding) (default:
              on).  Slightly slows down encoding and decoding, but should save
              10-15%  bitrate.  Unless you are looking for decoding speed, you
              should not disable it.

              quantizer  compression  (default: 0.6).  A lower value makes the
              bitrate more constant, while a higher value makes the  quantiza-
              tion parameter more constant.

              Temporal  blur  of  the estimated frame complexity, before curve
              compression (default: 20).  Lower  values  allow  the  quantizer
              value  to  jump around more, higher values force it to vary more
              smoothly.  cplx_blur ensures that each I-frame has quality  com-
              parable  to the following P-frames, and ensures that alternating
              high and low complexity frames (e.g. low fps animation)  do  not
              waste bits on fluctuating quantizer.

              Temporal  blur  of  the quantization parameter, after curve com-
              pression (default: 0.5).  Lower values allow the quantizer value
              to jump around more, higher values force it to vary more smooth-
              ly.

                 p4x4 Enable types p8x4, p4x8, p4x4.  p4x4 is recommended only
                      with subq >= 5, and only at low resolutions.
                 b8x8 Enable types b16x8, b8x16, b8x8.
                 i8x8 Enable type i8x8.  i8x8 has no effect unless  8x8dct  is
                      enabled.
                 i4x4 Enable type i4x4.
                 all  Enable all of the above types.
                 none Disable all of the above types.
              Regardless  of this option, macroblock types p16x16, b16x16, and
              i16x16 are always enabled.
              The idea is to find the type and size that best describe a  cer-
              tain  area  of the picture.  For example, a global pan is better
              represented by 16x16 blocks, while small moving objects are bet-
              ter represented by smaller blocks.

              Adaptive  spatial  transform  size: allows macroblocks to choose
              between 4x4 and 8x8 DCT.  Also allows the i8x8 macroblock  type.
              Without this option, only 4x4 DCT is used.

              subq=1.

                      date macroblock types.  Then selects the best type  with
                      SAD  metric  (faster than subq=1, not recommended unless
                      you're looking for ultra-fast encoding).
                 1    Does as 0, then refines the motion of that type to  fast

                      SATD  metric.   Then  refines the motion of that type to
                      fast quarterpixel precision.
                 3    As 2, but uses a slower quarterpixel refinement.
                 4    Runs fast quarterpixel precision  motion  estimation  on

                      tion on all candidate macroblock types, before selecting
                      the best type.  Also refines the two motion vectors used
                      in bidirectional macroblocks with  SATD  metric,  rather
                      than  reusing  vectors  from  the  forward  and backward

              In the above, "all candidates" does not exactly mean all enabled
              types: 4x4, 4x8, 8x4 are tried only if 8x8 is better than 16x16.

       ddeeaaddzzoonnee__iinntteerr==<<00--3322>>
              Set  the  size  of the inter luma quantization deadzone for non-
              trellis quantization (default: 21).  Lower values help  to  pre-
              serve fine details and film grain (typically useful for high bi-
              trate/quality encode), while higher values help filter out these
              details  to  save  bits  that  can  be spent again on other mac-
              roblocks and frames (typically useful  for  bitrate-starved  en-
              codes).   It  is  recommended  that  you start by tweaking dead-
              zone_intra before changing this parameter.

       ddeeaaddzzoonnee__iinnttrraa==<<00--3322>>
              Set the size of the intra luma quantization  deadzone  for  non-
              trellis  quantization  (default:  11).  This option has the same
              effect as deadzone_inter except that it  affects  intra  frames.
              It  is recommended that you start by tweaking this parameter be-
              fore changing deadzone_inter.

              Performs early skip detection in  P-frames  (default:  enabled).
              This  usually  improves  speed  at no cost, but it can sometimes
              produce artifacts in areas with no details, like sky.

       ((nnoo))ddcctt__ddeecciimmaattee
              Eliminate dct blocks in P-frames containing only a small  single
              coefficient  (default: enabled).  This will remove some details,
              so it will save bits that can be spent again  on  other  frames,
              hopefully  raising  overall subjective quality.  If you are com-
              pressing non-anime content with a high target bitrate,  you  may
              want to disable this to preserve as much detail as possible.

       nnrr==<<00--110000000000>>
              Noise  reduction,  0 means disabled.  100-1000 is a useful range
              for typical content, but you may want to turn it up a  bit  more
              for  very noisy content (default: 0).  Given its small impact on
              speed, you might want to prefer to use this over filtering noise
              away with video filters like denoise3d or hqdn3d.

              Controls how much adaptive quantization  (AQ)  reduces  blocking
              and blurring in flat and textured areas (default: 1.0).  A value
              of 0.5 will lead to weak AQ and less details, when  a  value  of
              1.5 will lead to strong AQ and more details.

              standard  (default:  51  - level 5.1).  This is used for telling
              the decoder what capabilities it needs to support.  Use this pa-

       ((nnoo))vviissuuaalliizzee
              Enable x264 visualizations during encoding.  If the x264 on your
              system  supports  it, a new window will be opened during the en-
              coding process, in which x264 will attempt to present  an  over-
              view of how each frame gets encoded.  Each block type on the vi-
              sualized movie will be colored as follows:
                 red/pink
                      intra block

              This feature can  be  considered  experimental  and  subject  to
              change.   In  particular, it depends on x264 being compiled with
              visualizations enabled.  Note that  as  of  writing  this,  x264
              pauses  after  encoding  and visualizing each frame, waiting for
              the user to press a key, at which point the next frame  will  be
              encoded.

              Uses  a  better algorithm to interleave audio and video packets,
              based on the principle that the muxer will always  try  to  fill

              what you are doing.  A too high value may lead to an  unplayable
              movie, depending on the player's capabilities.  When muxing HDTV

              turing date.  If DVDCSS_CACHE is not set or is empty,  libdvdcss

                 key
                      is the default method.  libdvdcss will use a set of cal-
                      culated player keys to try and get the disc  key.   This
                      can  fail  if  the  drive  does not recognize any of the

                 disc
                      is a fallback method when key has  failed.   Instead  of
                      using player keys, libdvdcss will crack the disc key us-
                      ing a brute force algorithm.  This process is CPU inten-
                      sive and requires 64 MB of memory to store temporary da-
                      ta.
                 title
                      is the fallback when all other methods have failed.   It
                      does  not rely on a key exchange with the DVD drive, but
                      rather uses a crypto attack to guess the title key.   On
                      rare cases this may fail because there is not enough en-
                      crypted data on the disc to perform  a  statistical  at-
                      tack,  but  in  the other hand it is the only way to de-
                      crypt a DVD stored on a hard disc, or  a  DVD  with  the
                      wrong region on an RPC2 drive.

              controlling  alphablending settings.  You can then manipulate it
              yourself with 'ivtvfbctl'.

       You  can also use -afm hwac3 instead of -ac hwdts.  Adjust '/dev/cdrom'
       to match the CD-ROM device on your system.  If your  external  receiver
       supports decoding raw DTS streams, you can directly play it via cdda://
       without setting format, hwac3 or hwdts.
